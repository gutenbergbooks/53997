      NOTE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The slight geographical confusion which will be found by the observant
      reader in <i>Hills of Han</i> is employed as a reminder that the story,
      despite considerable elements of fact in the background, is a work of the
      imagination, and deals with no actual individuals of the time and place.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N a day in late
      March, 1907, Miss Betty Doane sat in the quaintly airy dining-room of the
      Hotel Miyaka, at Kioto, demurely sketching a man's profile on the back of
      a menu card.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man, her unconscious model, lounged comfortably alone by one of the
      swinging windows. He had finished his luncheon, pushed away his coffee
      cup, lighted a cigarette, and settled back to gaze out at the hillside
      where young green grasses and gay shrubs and diminutive trees bore
      pleasant evidence that the early Japanese springtime was at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty could even see, looking out past the man, a row of cherry trees, all
      afoam with blossoms. They brought a thrill that was almost poignant. It
      was curious, at home&mdash;or, rather, back in the States&mdash;there was
      no particular thrill in cherry blossoms. They were merely pleasing. But so
      much more was said about them here in Japan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man's head was long and well modeled, with a rugged long face,
      reflective eyes, somewhat bony nose, and a wide mouth that was, on the
      whole, attractive. Both upper lip and chin were dean shaven. The eyebrows
      were rather heavy; the hair was thick and straight, slanting down across a
      broad forehead. She decided, as she sketched it in with easy sure strokes
      of a stubby pencil, that he must have quite a time every morning brushing
      that hair down into place.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had appeared, a few days back, at the Grand Hotel, Yokohama, coming in
      from somewhere north of Tokio. At the hotel he had walked and eaten alone,
      austerely. And, not unnaturally, had been whispered about. He was, Betty
      knew, a journalist of some reputation. The name was Jonathan Brachey. He
      wore an outing suit, with knickerbockers; he was, in bearing, as in
      costume, severely conspicuous. You thought of him as a man of odd
      attainment. He had been in many interesting corners of the world; had
      known danger and privation. Two of his books were in the ship's library.
      One of these she had already taken out and secreted in her cabin. It was
      called <i>To-morrow in India</i>, and proved rather hard to read, with
      charts, diagrams and pages of figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sketch was about done; all but the nose. When you studied that nose in
      detail it seemed a little too long and strong, and&mdash;well, knobby&mdash;to
      be as attractive as it actually was. There would be a trick in drawing it;
      a shadow or two, a suggestive touch of the pencil; not so many real knobs.
      In the ship's diningroom she had his profile across an aisle. There would
      be chances to study it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind her, in the wide doorway, appeared a stout, short woman of fifty or
      more, in an ample and wrinkled traveling suit of black and a black straw
      hat ornamented only with a bow of ribbon. Her face wore an anxious
      expression that had settled, years back, into permanency. The mouth
      drooped a little. And the brows were lifted and the forehead grooved with
      wrinkles suggesting some long habitual straining of the eyes that recent
      bifocal spectacles were powerless to correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty!&rdquo; called the older woman guardedly. &ldquo;Would you mind, dear... one
      moment...?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her quick, nervous eyes had caught something of the situation. There was
      Betty and&mdash;within easy earshot&mdash;a man. The child was
      unquestionably sketching him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty's eagerly alert young face fell at the sound. She stopped drawing;
      for a brief instant chewed the stubby pencil; then, quite meekly, rose and
      walked toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hasmer is outside. I thought you were with him. Betty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No... I didn't know your plans... I was waiting here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear... it's all right, of course! But I think we'll go now. Mr.
      Hasmer thinks you ought to see at least one of the temples. Something
      typical. And of course you will want to visit the cloisonné and <i>satsuma</i>
      shops, and see the Damascene work. The train leaves for Kobe at
      four-fifteen. The ships sails at about eight, I believe. We haven't much
      time, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A chair scraped. Jonathan Brachey had picked up his hat, his pocket camera
      and his unread copy of the Japan <i>Times</i>, and was striding toward
      her, or toward the door. He would pass directly by, of course, without so
      much as a mental recognition of her existence. For so he had done at
      Yokohama; so he had done last evening and again this morning on the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on this occasion, as he bore down on her, the eyes of the
      distinguished young man rested for an instant on the table, and for a
      brief moment he wavered in his stride. He certainly saw the sketch. It lay
      where she had carelessly tossed it, face up, near the edge of the table.
      And he certainly recognized it for himself; for his strong facial muscles
      moved a very little. It couldn't have been called a smile; but those
      muscles distinctly moved. Then, as coolly as before, he strode on out of
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty's cheeks turned crimson. A further fact doubtless noted by this
      irritatingly, even arrogantly composed man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty, with desperate dignity, put the sketch in her wrist bag, followed
      Mrs. Hasmer out of the building, and stepped into the rickshaw that
      awaited her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brown-legged coolie tucked the robe about her, stepped in between the
      shafts of the vehicle; a second coolie fell into place behind, and they
      were off down the hill. Just ahead, Mrs. Hasmer's funny little hat bobbed
      with the inequalities of the road. Just behind, Doctor Hasmer, a calm,
      patient man who taught philosophy and history in a Christian college
      fifteen hundred miles or more up the Yangtse River and who never could
      remember to have his silvery beard trimmed, smiled kindly at her when she
      turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      And behind him, indifferent to all the human world, responsive in his
      frigid way only to the beauties of the Japanese country-side and of the
      quaint, gray-brown, truly ancient city extending up and down the valley by
      its narrow, stone-walled stream, rode Mr. Jonathan Brachey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coolies, it would seem, had decided to act in concert. From shop to
      shop among the crowded little streets went the four rickshaws. Any mere
      human being (so ran Betty's thoughts) would have accepted good-humoredly
      the comradeship implied in this arrangement on the part of a playful fate;
      but Mr. Brachey was no mere human being. Side by side stood the four of
      them in a toy workshop looking down at toy-like artisans with shaved and
      tufted heads who wore quaint robes and patiently beat out designs in gold
      and silver wire on expertly fashioned bronze boxes and bowls. They
      listened as one to the thickly liquid English of a smiling merchant
      explaining the processes and expanding on the history of fine handiwork in
      this esthetic land. Yet by no sign did Mr. Brachey's face indicate that he
      was aware of their presence; except once&mdash;on a crooked stairway in a
      cloisonné shop he flattened himself against the wall to let them pass,
      muttering, almost fiercely, &ldquo;I beg your pardon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moment came, apparently, when he could endure this enforced
      companionship no longer. He spoke gruffly to his rickshaw coolies, and
      rolled off alone. When they finally reached the railway station after a
      half-hour spent in wandering about the spacious enclosure of the Temple of
      Nishi Otani, with its huge, shadowy gate house, its calm priests, its
      exquisite rock garden under ancient mystical trees&mdash;the tall
      journalist was pacing the platform, savagely smoking a pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Kobe they were united again, riding out to the ship's anchorage in the
      same launch. But Mr. Brachey gave no sign of recognition. He disappeared
      the moment of arrival at the ship, reappearing only when the bugle
      announced dinner, dressed, as he had been each evening at the Grand Hotel
      and the previous evening on the ship, rather stiffly, in dinner costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the ship moved out from her anchorage into that long, island-studded,
      green-bordered body of water known as the Inland Sea of Japan. Early on
      the second morning she would slip in between the closepressing hills that
      guard Nagasaki harbor. There another day ashore. Then three days more
      across the Yellow Sea to Shanghai. Thence, for the Hasmers and Betty, a
      five-day journey by steamer up the muddy but majestic Yangtze Kiang to
      Hankow; at which important if hardly charming city they would separate,
      the Hasmers to travel on by other, smaller steamer to Ichang and thence on
      up through the Gorges to their home among the yellow folk of Szechwan,
      while Hetty, from Hankow, must set out into an existence that her highly
      colored young mind found it impossible to face squarely. As yet, despite
      the long journey across the American continent and the Pacific, she hadn't
      begun so much as to believe the facts. Though there they stood, squarely
      enough, before her. It had been easier to surrender her responsive, rather
      easily gratified emotions to a day-by-day enjoyment of the journey itself.
      When the constant, worried watchfulness of Mrs. Hasmer reached the point
      of annoyance&mdash;not that Mrs. Hasmer wasn't an old dear; kindness
      itself, especially if your head ached or you needed a little mothering!&mdash;why
      then, with the easy adaptability and quick enthusiasm of youth, she simply
      busied herself sketching. The top layer of her steamer trunk was nearly
      full now&mdash;sketches of the American desert, of the mountains and San
      Francisco, of people on the ship, of the sea and of Honolulu.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, with Yokohama back among the yesterdays and Kobe falling rapidly,
      steadily astern, Betty's heart was as rapidly and as steadily sinking.
      Only one more stop, and then&mdash;China. In China loomed the facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, lying in her berth, Betty, forgot the cherry blossoms of Kioto
      and the irritating Mr. Brachey. Her thoughts dwelt among the young
      friends, the boy-and-girl &ldquo;crowd,&rdquo; she had left behind, far off, at the
      other edge of those United States that by a queerly unreal theory were her
      home-land. And, very softly, she cried herself to sleep.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>etty Doane was
      just nineteen. She was small, quick to feel and think, dark rather than
      light (though not an out-and-out brunette). She was distinctly pretty. Her
      small head with its fine and abundant hair, round face with its ever-ready
      smile, alert brown eyes and curiously strong little chin expressed, as did
      her slim quick body, a personality of considerable sprightly vigor and of
      a charm that could act on certain other sorts of personalities,
      particularly of the opposite sex, with positive, telling effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hasmer, who had undertaken, with misgivings, to bring her from
      suburban New Jersey to Hankow, found her a heavy responsibility. It wasn't
      that the child was insubordinate, forward, or, in anyway that you could
      blame her for, difficult. On the contrary, she was a dear little thing,
      kind, always amusing, eager to please. But none the less there was
      something, a touch of vital quality, perhaps of the rare gift of
      expressiveness, that gave her, at times, a rather alarming aspect. Her
      clothes were simple enough&mdash;Griggsby Doane, goodness knew, couldn't
      afford anything else&mdash;but in some way that Mrs. Hasmer would never
      fully understand, the child always managed to make them look better than
      they were. She had something of the gift of smartness. She had, Mrs.
      Hasmer once came out with, &ldquo;too much imagination.&rdquo; The incessant
      sketching, for instance. And she did it just a shade too well. Then, too,
      evening after evening during the three weeks on the Pacific, she had
      danced. Which was, from the only daughter of Griggsby Doane&mdash;well,
      confusing. And though Mrs. Hasmer, balked by the delicacy of her position,
      had gone to lengths in concealing her disapproval, she had been unable to
      feign surprise at the resulting difficulties. Betty had certainly not been
      deliberate in leading on any of the men on the ship; young men, by the way
      that you had no means of looking up, even so far as the certainty that
      they were unmarried. But the young mining engineer on his way to Korea had
      left quite heart-broken. From all outer indications he had proposed
      marriage and met with a refusal. But not a word, not a hint, not so much
      as a telltale look, came from Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hasmer sighed over it. She would have liked to know. She came to the
      conclusion that Betty had been left just a year or so too long in the
      States. They weren't serious over there, in the matter of training girls
      for the sober work of life. Prosperity, luxury, were telling on the
      younger generations. No longer were they guarded from dangerously free
      thinking. They read, heard, saw everything; apparently knew everything.
      They read openly, of a Sunday, books which, a generation earlier, would
      not have reached their eyes even on a week-day. The church seemed to have
      lost its hold (though she never spoke aloud of this fact). Respect for
      tradition and authority had crumbled away. They questioned, weighed
      everything, these modern children.... Mrs. Hasmer worried a good deal, out
      in China, about young people in the States.
    </p>
    <p>
      But under these surface worries, lurked, in the good woman's mind, a
      deeper, more real worry. Betty was just stepping over the line between
      girlhood and young womanhood. She was growing more attractive daily. She
      was anything but fitted to step into the life that lay ahead. Wherever she
      turned, even now&mdash;as witness the Pacific ship&mdash;life took on
      fresh complications. Indeed, Mrs. Hasmer, pondering the problem, came down
      on the rather strong word, peril. A young girl&mdash;positive in
      attractiveness, gifted, spirited, motherless (as it happened), trained
      only to be happy in living&mdash;was in something near peril.
    </p>
    <p>
      One fact which Mrs. Hasmer's mind had been forced to accept was that most
      of the complications came from sources or causes with which the girl
      herself had little consciously to do. She was flatly the sort of person to
      whom things happened. Even when her eager interest in life and things and
      men (young and old) was not busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the matter of the rather rude young man in knickerbockers, at Kioto,
      Betty was to blame, of course. She had set to work to sketch him.
      Evidently. The most you could say for her on that point was that she would
      have set just as intently at sketching an old man, or a woman, or a child&mdash;or
      a corner of the room. Mrs. Hasmer had felt, while on the train to Kobe,
      that she must speak of the matter. After all, she had that deathly
      responsibility on her shoulders. Betty's only explanation, rather gravely
      given, had been that she found his nose interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The disturbing point was that something in the way of a situation was sure
      to develop from the incident. Something. Six weeks of Betty made that a
      reasonable assumption. And the first complication would arise in some
      quite unforeseen way. Betty wouldn't bring it about. Indeed, she had
      quickly promised not to sketch him any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the way it did arise. At eleven on the following morning Mr. and
      Mrs. Hasmer and Betty were stretched out side by side in their steamer
      chairs, sipping their morning beef tea and looking out at the rugged north
      shore of the Inland Sea. Beyond Betty were three vacant chairs, then this
      Mr. Brachey&mdash;his long person wrapped in a gay plaid rug. He too was
      sipping beef tea and enjoying the landscape; if so dry, so solitary a
      person could be said to enjoy anything. A note-book lay across his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hasmer had thought, with a momentary flutter of concern, of moving
      Betty to the other side of Doctor Hasmer. But that had seemed foolish.
      Making too much of it. Betty hadn't placed the chairs; the deck steward
      had done that. Besides she hadn't once looked at the man; probably hadn't
      thought of him; had been quite absorbed in her sketching&mdash;bits of the
      hilly shore, an island mirrored in glass, a becalmed junk.
    </p>
    <p>
      A youngish man, hatless, with blond curls and a slightly professional
      smile, came up from the after hatch and advanced along the deck, eagerly
      searching the row of rug-wrapped, recumbent figures in deck chairs. Before
      the Hasmers he stopped with delighted greetings. It came out that he was a
      Mr. Harting, a Y. M. C. A. worker in Bttrmah, traveling second-class.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hadn't seen the passenger list, Mrs. Hasmer, and didn't know you were
      aboard. But there's a Chinese boy sitting next to me at table. He has put
      in a year or so at Tokio University, and speaks a little English. He comes
      from your city, Miss Doane. Or so he seems to think. T'ainan-fu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty inclined her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was he who showed me the passenger list. At one time, he says, he
      lived in your father's household.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is his name?&rdquo; asked Betty politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Li Hsien&mdash;something or other.&rdquo; Mr. Harting was searching his pockets
      for a copy of the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew Li Hsien very well,&rdquo; said Betty. &ldquo;We used to play together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I gathered. May I bring him up here to see you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty would have replied at once in the affirmative, but six weeks of
      companionship with Mrs. Hasmer had taught her that such decisions were not
      expected of her. So now with a vague smile of acquiescence, she directed
      the inquiry to the older woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Hasmer, &ldquo;do bring him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he moved away, Betty, before settling back in her chair, glanced, once,
      very demurely, to her left, where Jonathan Brachey lay in what might have
      been described, from outer appearances, supercilious comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hadn't so much as lifted an eyelid. He wasn't listening. He didn't
      care. It was nothing to him that Betty Doane was no idle, spoiled girl
      tourist, nothing that she could draw with a gifted pencil, nothing that
      she knew Chinese students at Tokio University, and herself lived at
      T'ainan-fu!... It wasn't that Betty consciously formulated any such
      thoughts. But the man had an effect on her; made her uncomfortable; she
      wished he'd move his chair around to the other side of the ship.
    </p>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>i Hsien proved to
      be quite a young man, all of twenty or twenty-one. He had spectacles now,
      and gold in his teeth. He wore the conventional blue robe, Liack skull-cap
      with red button, and queue. More than four years were yet to elapse before
      the great revolution of 1911, with its wholesale queue-cutting and its
      rather frantic adoption, on the part of the better-to-do, of Western
      clothing&mdash;or, rather, of what they supposed was Western clothing....
      He was tall, slim, smiling. He shook hands with Betty, Western fashion;
      and bowed with courtly dignity to Doctor and Mrs. Hasmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      His manner had an odd effect on Betty. For six years now she had lived in
      Orange. She had passed through the seventh and eighth grades of the public
      school and followed that with a complete course of four years in high
      school. She had fallen naturally and whole-heartedly into the life of a
      nice girl in an American suburb. She had gone to parties, joined
      societies, mildly entangled herself with a series of boy admirers. Despite
      moderate but frank poverty she had been popular. And in this healthy,
      active young life she had very nearly forgotten the profoundly different
      nature of her earlier existence. But now that earlier feeling for life was
      coming over her like a wave. After all, her first thirteen years had been
      lived out in a Chinese city. And they were the most impressionable years.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was by no means a pleasant sensation. She had never loved China; had
      simply endured it, knowing little else. America she loved. It was of her
      blood, of her instinct. But now it was abruptly slipping out of her grasp&mdash;school,
      home, the girls, the boys, long evenings of chatter and song on a &ldquo;front
      porch,&rdquo; picnics on that ridge known locally as &ldquo;the mountain,&rdquo; matinées in
      New York, glorious sunset visions of high buildings from a ferry-boat, a
      thrilling, ice-caked river in winter-time, the misty beauties of the
      Newark meadows&mdash;all this was curiously losing its vividness in her
      mind, and drab old China was slipping stealthily but swiftly into its
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knit her brows. She was suddenly helpless, in a poignantly
      disconcerting way. A word came&mdash;rootless. That was it; she was
      rootless. For an instant she had to fight back the tears that seldom came
      in the daytime.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then she looked again at Li Hsien.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was smiling. It came to her, fantastically, that he, too, was rootless.
      And yet he smiled. She knew, instantly, that his feelings were quite as
      fine as hers. He was sensitive, strung high. He had been that sort of boy.
      For that matter the Chinese had been a cultured people when the whites
      were crude barbarians. She knew that. She couldn't have put it into words,
      but she knew it. And so she, too, smiled. And when she spoke, asking him
      to sit in the vacant chair next to her, she spoke without a thought, in
      Chinese, the middle Hansi dialect.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Mr. Jonathan Brachey looked up, turned squarely around and stared
      at her for one brief instant. After which he recollected himself and
      turned abruptly back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harting dropped down on the farther side of Doctor Hasmer. Which left
      his good wife between the two couples, each now deep in talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hasmer's Chinese vocabulary was confined to a limited number of
      personal and household terms; and even these were in the dialect of
      eastern Szechwan. Just as a matter of taste, of almost elementary taste,
      it seemed to her that Betty should keep the conversation, or most of it,
      in English. She went so far as to lean over the arm of her chair and smile
      in a perturbed manner at the oddly contrasting couple who chatted so
      easily and pleasantly in the heathen tongue. She almost reached the point
      of speaking to Betty; gently, of course. But the girl clearly had no
      thought of possible impropriety. She was laughing now&mdash;apparently at
      some gap in her vocabulary&mdash;and the bland young man with the
      spectacles and the pigtail was humorously supplying the proper word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hasmer decided not to speak. She lay hack in her chair. The wrinkles
      in her forehead deepened a little. On the other side Mr. Halting was
      describing enthusiastically a new and complicated table that was equipped
      with every imaginable device for the demonstrating of experiments in
      physics to Burmese youth. It could be packed, he insisted, for transport
      from village to village, in a crate no larger than the table itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, again, she caught the musical intonation of the young Chinaman.
      Betty, surprisingly direct and practical in manner if unintelligible in
      speech, was asking questions, which Li Hsien answered in turn, easily,
      almost languidly, but with unfailing good nature. Though there were a few
      moments during which he spoke rapidly and rather earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hasmer next became aware of the odd effect the little scene was
      plainly having on Jonathan Brachey. He fidgeted in his chair; got up and
      stood at the rail; paced the deck, twice passing close to the comfortably
      extended feet of the Hasmer party and so ostentatiously <i>not</i> looking
      at them as to distract momentarily the attention even of the deeply
      engrossed Betty. Mr. Harting, even, looked up. After all of which the man,
      looking curiously stern, or irritated, or (Betty decided) something
      unpleasant, sat again in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, a little later, Mr. Harting and Li Hsien took their leave and
      returned to the second-class quarters, astern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hasmer thought, for a moment, that perhaps now was the time to
      suggest that English be made the common tongue in the future. But Betty's
      eager countenance disarmed her. She sighed. And sighed again; for the
      girl, stirred by what she was saying, had unconsciously raised her voice.
      And that tall man was listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's queer how fast things are changing out here,&rdquo; thus Betty. &ldquo;Li Hsien
      is&mdash;you'd never guess!&mdash;a Socialist! I asked him why he isn't
      staying out the year at Tokio University, and he said he was called home
      to help the Province. Think of it&mdash;that boy! They've got into some
      trouble over a foreign mining syndicate&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Ho Shan Company,&rdquo; explained Doctor Hasmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've been operating rather extensively in Plonan and southern Chihli,&rdquo;
       the educator continued, &ldquo;and I heard last year that they've made a fresh
      agreement with the Imperial Government giving them practically a monopoly
      of the coal and iron mining up there in the Hansi Hills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Doctor Hasmer, and he says that there's a good deal of feeling in
      the province. They've had one or two mass meetings of the gentry and
      people. He thinks they'll send a protest to Peking. He believes that the
      company got the agreement through bribery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all unlikely,&rdquo; remarked Doctor Hasmer mildly. &ldquo;I don't know that
      any other way has yet been discovered of obtaining commercial privileges
      from the Imperial Government. The Ho Shan Company is... let me see... as I
      recall, it was organized by that Italian promoter, Count Logatti. I
      believe he went to Germany, Belgium and France for the capital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Li has become an astonishing young man,&rdquo; said Betty more gravely. &ldquo;He
      talks about revolutions and republics. He doesn't think the Manchus can
      last much longer. The southern provinces are ready for the revolution now,
      he says&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; remarked Doctor Hasmer, &ldquo;is a little sweeping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Li is very sweeping,&rdquo; replied Betty. &ldquo;And he's going back now to
      T'ainan-fu for some definite reason. I couldn't make out what. I asked if
      he would be coming in to see father, and he said, probably not; that there
      wouldn't be any use in it. Then I asked him if he was still a Christian,
      and I think he laughed at me. He wouldn't say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation was broken by the appearance of a pleasant Englishman, an
      importer of silks, by the name of Obie. He had been thrown with the
      Hasmers and Betty in one of their sight-seeing jaunts about Tokio. Mr.
      Obie wore spats, and a scarf pin and cuff links of human bone from Borneo
      set in circlets of beaded gold. His light, usually amusing talk was
      liberally sprinkled with crisp phrases in pidgin-English.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke now of the beauties of the Inland Sea, and resumed his stroll
      about the deck. After a few turns, he went into the smoking-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonathan Brachey, still with that irritably nervous manner, watched him
      intently; finally got up and followed him, passing the Hasmers and Betty
      with nose held high.
    </p>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was early
      afternoon, when Mrs. Hasmer and Betty were dozing in their chairs, that
      Mr. Obie, looking slightly puzzled, came again to them. He held a card
      between thumb and forefinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Doane,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this gentleman asks permission to be presented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hasmer's hand went out a little way to receive the card; but Betty
      innocently took it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Jonathan Brachey,&rdquo; she read aloud. Then added, with a pretty touch of
      color&mdash;&ldquo;But how funny! He was with us yesterday, and <i>wouldn't</i>
      talk. And now....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My go catchee?&rdquo; asked Mr. Obie.
    </p>
    <p>
      To which little pleasantry Betty responded, looking very bright and
      pretty, with&mdash;&ldquo;Can do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She gives out too much,&rdquo; thought Mrs. Hasmer; deciding then and there
      that the meeting should be brief and the conversation triangular.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Obie brought him, formally, from the smoking-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed stiffly. Betty checked her natural impulse toward a hearty
      hard-grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hasmer, feeling hurried, a thought breathless, meant to offer him her
      husband's chair; but all in the moment Betty had him down beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came stark silence. The man stared out at the islands.

      Betty, finding her portfolio on her lap, fingered it. Then this:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must begin, Miss Doane, with an apology....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty's responsive face blanched. &ldquo;What a dreadful man!&rdquo; she thought. His
      voice was rather strong, dry, hard, with, even, a slight rasp in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he drove heavily on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning, while not wishing to appear as an eavesdropper... that is
      to say... the fact is, Miss Doane, I am a journalist, and am at present on
      my way to China to make an investigation of the political&mdash;one might
      even term it the social&mdash;unrest that appears to be cropping out
      rather extensively in the southern provinces and even, a little here and
      there, in the North.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was dreadful! Stilted, clumsy, slow! He hunted painstakingly for words;
      and at each long pause Betty's quick young nerves tightened and tightened,
      mentally groping with him until the hunted word was run to earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was pounding on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning I overheard you talking with that young Chinaman. It is
      evident that you speak the language.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh. yes,&rdquo; Betty found herself saying, &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not a word about the drawing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This young man, I gather, is in sympathy with the revolutionary spirit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&mdash;he seems to be,&rdquo; said Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now... Miss Doane... this is of course an imposition...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; breathed Betty weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;... it is, of course, an imposition... it would be a service I could
      perhaps never repay...&rdquo; This pause lasted so long that she heard herself
      murmuring, &ldquo;No, really, not at all!&rdquo;&mdash;and then felt the color
      creeping to her face... but if I might ask you to... but let me put it in
      this way&mdash;the young man is precisely the type I have come out here to
      study. You speak in the vernacular, and evidently understand him almost as
      a native might. It is unlikely I shall find in China many such natural
      interpreters as yourself. And of course... if it is thinkable that you
      would be so extremely kind as to... why, of course, I...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; thought Betty, in a panic, &ldquo;he's going to offer to pay me. I
      mustn't be rude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man plodded on: &ldquo;... why, of course, it would be a real pleasure to
      mention your assistance in the preface of my book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was partly luck, luck and innate courtesy, that she didn't laugh aloud.
      She broke, as it was, into words, saving herself and the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want me to act as interpreter? Of course Li knows a little English.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would he&mdash;er&mdash;know enough English for serious conversation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; mused Betty aloud, &ldquo;I don't think he would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, Miss Doane, I quite realize that to take up your time in this
      way....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There he stopped. He was frowning now, and apparently studying out the
      structural details of a huge junk that lay only a few hundred yards away,
      reflected minutely, exquisitely&mdash;curving hull and deck cargo,
      timbered stern, bat-wing sails&mdash;in the glass-like water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be glad to do what I can,&rdquo; said Betty, helplessly. Then, for the
      first time, she became aware that Mrs. Hasmer was stirring uncomfortably
      on her other hand, and added, quickly, as much out of nervousness as
      anything else&mdash;&ldquo;We could arrange to have Li come up here in the
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be coaling at Nagasaki in the morning,&rdquo; said he, abruptly, as if
      that settled <i>that</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course,... this afternoon....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; began Mrs. Hasmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This afternoon would be better.&rdquo; Thus Mr. Brachey. &ldquo;Though I can not tell
      you what hesitation...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose we could find a quiet corner somewhere,&rdquo; said Betty. &ldquo;In the
      social hall, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was then, stirred to positive act, that Mrs. Hasmer spoke out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you'd better stay out here with us, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To which the hopelessly self-absorbed Mr. Brachey replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really must have quiet for this work. We will sit inside, if you don't
      mind.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t half past four
      Mrs. Hasmer sent her husband to look into the situation. He reported that
      they were hard at it. Betty looked a little tired, but was laboriously
      repeating Li Hsien's words, in English, in order that Mr. Brachcy might
      take them down in what appeared to be a sort of shorthand. Doctor Hasmer
      didn't see how he could say anything. Not very well. They hadn't so much
      as noticed him, though he stood near by for a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which report Mrs. Hasmer found masculine and unsatisfactory. At five she
      went herself; took her Battenberg hoop and sat near by. Betty saw her, and
      smiled. She looked distinctly a little wan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journalist ignored Mrs. Hasmer. He was a merciless driver. Whenever
      Betty's attention wandered, as it had begun doing, he put his questions
      bruskly, even sharply, to call her back to the task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four bells sounded, up forward. Mrs. Hasmer started; and, as always when
      she heard the ship's bell, consulted her watch. Six o'clock!... She put
      down her hoop; fidgetted; got up; sat down again; told herself she must
      consider the situation calmly. It must be taken in hand, of course. The
      man was a mannerless brute. He had distinctly encroached. He would
      encroach further. He must be met firmly, at once. She tried to think
      precisely how he could be met.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got up again; stood over them. She didn't know that her face was a
      lens through which any and all might read her perturbed spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty glanced up; smiled faintly; drew a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Li Hsien rose and bowed, clasping his hands before his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bradley was writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hasmer had tried to construct a little speech that, however final,
      would meet the forms of courtesy. It left her now. She said with blank
      firmness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Betty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment!&rdquo; protested Mr. Brachey. &ldquo;Will you please ask him, Miss Duane,
      whether he believes that the general use of opium has appreciably lowered
      the vitality of the Chinese people? That is, to put it conversely, whether
      the curtailment of production is going to leave a people too weakened to
      act strongly in a military or even political way? Surveying the empire as
      a whole, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty's thoughts, which had wandered hopelessly afield, came struggling
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I'm sorry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I'm afraid I didn't quite hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must ask you to come with me, Betty,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hasmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this, looking heavily disappointed, Mr. Brachey rose; ran a long bony
      hand through his thick hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We could take it up in the morning,&rdquo; he said, turning from the bland
      young Chinaman to the plainly confused girl. &ldquo;That is, if Miss Doane
      wouldn't mind staying on the ship. I presume she has seen Nagasaki.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His perturbed eyes moved at last to the little elderly lady who had seemed
      so colorless and mild; met hers, which were, of a sudden, snapping coals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not take it up again, sir!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Hasmer; and left with the
      girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chinaman smiled, clasped his hands, bowed with impenetrable courtesy,
      and withdrew' to his quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brachey, alone, looked over his notes with a frown; shook his head;
      went down to dress for dinner.
    </p>
    <h3>
      6
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ate that night
      Betty sat in her tiny stateroom, indulging rebellious thoughts. It was
      time, after an awkwardly silent evening, to go to bed. But instead she now
      slipped into her heavy traveling coat, pulled on her tam-o'-shanter,
      tiptoed past the Hasmers' door and went out on deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dim and peaceful there. The throb of the engines and the wash of
      water along the hull were the only sounds. They were in the strait now,
      heading out to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked around the deck, and around. It was her first free moment since
      they left the Pacific ship at Yokohama. After that very quietly&mdash;sweetly,
      even&mdash;the chaperonage of Mrs. Hasmer had tightened. For Betty the
      experience was new and difficult. She felt that she ought to submit. But
      the rebellion in her breast, if wrong, was real. She would walk it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she met Mr. Brachey coming out of the smoking-room. Both stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just getting a breath of air,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they moved to the rail and leaned there, gazing off at the faintly
      moonlit land.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked, in his cold way, how she had learned Chinese.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was born at T'ainan-fu,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;My father is a missionary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he. And again, &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then they fell silent. Her impulse at first was to make talk. She did
      murmur, &ldquo;I really ought to be going in.&rdquo; But he, apparently, found talk
      unnecessary. And she stayed on, looking now down at the iridescent foam
      slipping past the black hull, now up into the luminous night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he remarked, casually, &ldquo;Shall we walk?&rdquo; And she found herself falling
      into step with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stopped, a little later, up forward and stood looking out over the
      forecastle deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day I'm going to ask the chief officer to let me go out there,&rdquo; said
      she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't necessary to ask him,&rdquo; replied Mr. Brachey. &ldquo;Come along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; murmured Betty, half in protest&mdash;&ldquo;really?&rdquo; But she went,
      thrilled now, more than a little guilty, down the steps, past hatches and
      donkey engines, up other steps, under and over a tangle of cables, over an
      immense anchor, to seats on coils of rope near the very bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation amounted already to a secret. Mrs. Hasmer couldn't be told,
      mused Betty. The fact was a little perplexing. But it stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither had mentioned Mrs. Hasmer. But now he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was rude to-day, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! I'm that way. The less I see of people the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This touched the half-fledged woman in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're interested in your work,&rdquo; said she gently. &ldquo;That's all. And it's
      right. You're not a trifler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a lone wolf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was beginning to find him out-and-out interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You travel a good deal,&rdquo; she ventured demurely. &ldquo;All the time. I prefer
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't get lonesome?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. But what does it matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She considered this. &ldquo;You go into dangerous places.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You traveled among the head-hunters of Borneo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you find that out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's an advertisment of that book in <i>To-morrow in India</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, have you read that thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Part of it. I...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You found it dull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well... it's a little over my head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's over everybody's. Mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nearly laughed at this. But he seemed not to think of it as humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you a little afraid, sometimes&mdash;going into such dangerous
      places all alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you might be hurt&mdash;or even&mdash;killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the difference?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Startled, she looked straight up at him; then dropped her eyes. She waited
      for him to explain, but he was gazing moodily out at the water ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soft night air wrapped them about like dream-velvet. Adventure was
      astir, and romance. Betty, enchanted, looked lazily back at the white
      midships decks, bridge and wheelhouse, at the mysterious rigging and
      raking masts, at the foremost of the huge funnels pouring out great
      rolling clouds of smoke. The engines throbbed and throbbed. Back there
      somewhere the ship's bell struck, eight times for midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care much for missionaries,&rdquo; said Mr. Brachey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd like father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a wonderful man. He's six feet five. And strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a job for little men. Little souls. With little narrow eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh... No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why try to change the Chinese? Their philosophy is finer than ours. And
      works better. I like them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I. But...&rdquo; She wished her father could be there to meet the man's
      talk. There must surely be strong arguments on the missionary side, if one
      only knew them. She finally came out with:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they're heathen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're&mdash;they're polygamous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mr. Brachey...&rdquo; She couldn't go on with this. The conversation was
      growing rather alarming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So are the Americans polygamous. And the other white peoples. Only they
      call it by other names. You get tired of it. The Chinese are more honest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said she, suddenly steady and shrewd, &ldquo;if you haven't stayed
      away too long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His reply was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you live&mdash;you know, all by yourself, and for nobody in the world
      except yourself&mdash;I mean, if there's nobody you're responsible for,
      nobody you love and take care of and suffer for...&rdquo; The sentence was
      getting something involved. She paused, puckering her brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I only meant, isn't there danger of a person like that becoming&mdash;well,
      just selfish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am selfish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don't want to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh. but I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can hardly believe that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dependence on others is as bad as gratitude. It is a demand, a weakness.
      Strength is better. If each of us stood selfishly alone, it would be a
      cleaner, better world. There wouldn't be any of this mess of obligation,
      one to another. No running up of spiritual debt. And that's the worst
      kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose,&rdquo; she began, a little afraid of getting into depths from
      which it might be difficult to extreate herself, &ldquo;suppose&mdash;well, you
      were married, and there were&mdash;well, little children. Surely you'd
      have to feel responsible for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said he curtly, &ldquo;it isn't necessary for every man to bring
      children 'nto the world. Surely that's not the only job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but take another case. Suppose you had a friend, a younger man,
      and he was in trouble&mdash;drinking, maybe; anything!&mdash;wouldn't you
      feel responsible for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. That's the worst kind of dependence. The only battles a man
      wins are the ones he wins alone. If any friend of mine&mdash;man or woman&mdash;can't
      win his own battles&mdash;or hers&mdash;he or she had better go. Anywhere.
      To hell, if it comes to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He quite took her breath away.
    </p>
    <p>
      One bell sounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's perfectly dreadful,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;If Mrs. Has-mer knew I was out here
      at this time of night, she'd...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This sentence died out. They went back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt that he must think her very young and simple. It seemed odd that
      he should waste so much time on her. No other man she had ever met was
      like him. Hesitantly, desiring at least a touch of friendliness, on an
      impulse, she extended her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took it; held it a moment firmly; then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you give me that drawing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; And she tiptoed twice again past the Hasmers' door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please sign it,&rdquo; said he, and produced a pencil. &ldquo;But it seems so silly.
      I mean, it's nothing, this sketch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She signed it, said good night again, and hurried off, her heart in a
      curious flutter.

      CHAPTER II&mdash;ROMANCE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">U</span>NWILLING either to
      confess like a naughty child or to go on keeping this rather large and
      distinctly exciting secret under cover, Betty, at teatime, brought the
      matter to an issue. The morning ashore had been difficult. Mr. Brachey had
      severely ignored her, going about Nagasaki alone, lunching in austere
      solitude at the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said, settling herself in the deck chair:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Hasmer, will you ask Mr. Brachey to have tea with us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a long silence the older woman asked, stiffly: &ldquo;Why, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty compressed her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Hasmer saved the situation by saying quietly, &ldquo;I'll ask him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was awkward from the first. The man was angular and unyielding. And
      Mrs. Hasmer, though she tried, couldn't let him alone. She was determined
      to learn whether he was married. She led up to the direct question more
      otariously than she knew. Finally it came. They were speaking of his
      announced plan to travel extensively in the interior of China.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be quite delightful to wander as you do,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Of course,
      if one has ties... you, I take it, are an unmarried man, Mr. Brachey ?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty had to lower her face to hide the color that came. If only Mrs.
      Hasmer had a little humor! She was a dear kind woman; but this!...
    </p>
    <p>
      The journalist looked, impassively enough, but directly, at his
      questioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      She met his gaze. They were flint on steel, these two natures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are obviously not married,&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked down at his teacup; thinking. Then, abruptly, he set it down on
      the deck, got up, muttered something that sounded like, &ldquo;If you will
      excuse me...&rdquo; and strode away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty went early to her cabin that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had no more than switched on her light when the Chinese steward came
      with a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She locked the door then, and looked at the unfamiliar handwriting. It was
      small, round, clear; the hand of a particular man, a meticulous man. who
      has written much with a pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned down the little wicker seat. Her cheeks were suddenly hot, her
      pulse bounding high.
    </p>
    <p>
      She skimmed it, at first, clear to the signature, &ldquo;Jonathan Brachey&rdquo;; then
      went back and read it through, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was rude again just now,&rdquo; (it began). &ldquo;As I told you last night, it is
      best for me not to see people. I am not a social being. Clearly, from this
      time on, it will be impossible for me to talk with this Mrs. Hasmer. I
      shall not try again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not answer her question. But to you I must speak. It would be
      difficult even to do this if we were to meet again, and talk. But, as you
      will readily see, we must not meet again, beyond the merest greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was married four years ago. After only a few weeks my wife left me. The
      reasons she gave were so flippant as to be absurd. She was a beautiful
      and, it has seemed to me, a vain, spoiled, quite heartless woman. I have
      not seen her since. Two years ago she became infatuated with another man,
      and wrote asking me to consent to a divorce. I refused on the ground that
      I did not care to enter into the legal intrigues preliminary to a divorce
      in the state of her residence. Since then, I am told, she has changed her
      residence to a state in which 'desertion' is a legal ground. But I have
      received no word of any actual move on her part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is strange that I should be writing thus frankly to you. Strange, and
      perhaps wrong. But you have reached out to me more of a helping hand than
      you will ever know. Our talk last night meant a great deal to me. To you I
      doubtless seemed harsh and forbidding. It is true that I am that sort of
      man, and therefore am best alone. It is seldom that I meet a person with
      whom my ideas are in agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust that you will find every happiness in life. You deserve to. You
      have the great gift of feeling. I could almost envy you that. It is a
      quality I can perceive without possessing. An independent mind, a strong
      gift of logic, stands between me and all human affection. I must say what
      I think, not what I feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I make people unhappy. The only corrective to such a nature is work, and,
      whenever possible, solitude. But I do not solicit your pity. I find
      myself, my thoughts, excellent company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With your permission I will keep the drawing. It will have a peculiar and
      pleasant meaning to me.&rdquo;
     </p>

    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>etty lowered the
      letter, breathing out the single word, &ldquo;Well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What on earth could she have said or done to give him any such footing in
      her life?
    </p>
    <p>
      She read it again. And then again.
    </p>
    <p>
      An amazing man!
    </p>
    <p>
      She made, ready to go to bed, slowly, dawdling, trying to straighten out
      the curious emotional pressures on her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      She read the letter yet again; considered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, after passing through many moods leading up to a tender sympathy
      for this bleak life, and then passing on into a state of sheer nervous
      excitement, she deliberately dressed again and went out on deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood by the rail, smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have my letter?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I've read it.&rdquo; She was oddly, happily relieved at finding him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shouldn't have come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had no answer to this. It seemed hardly relevant. She smiled, in the
      dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      They fell to walking the deck. After a time, shyly, tacitly, a little
      embarrassed, they went up forward again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ship was well out in the Yellow Sea now. The bow rose and fell slowly,
      rhythmically, beneath them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moved to meet his letter with a response in kind, she talked of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems strange to be coming back to China.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've been long away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six years. My mother died when I was thirteen. Father thought it would be
      better for me to be in the States. My uncle, father's brother, was in the
      wholesale hardware business in New York, and lived in Orange, and they
      took me in. They were always nice to me. But last fall Uncle Frank came
      down with rheumatic gout. He's an invalid now. It must have been pretty
      expensive. And there was some trouble in his business. They couldn't very
      well go on taking care of me, so father decided to have me come back to
      T'ainan-fu.&rdquo; She folded her hands in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lighted his pipe, and smoked reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be rather hard for you, won't it?&rdquo; he remarked, after a time.
      &ldquo;I mean for a person of your temperament. You are, I should say, almost
      exactly my opposite in every respect. You like people, friends. You are
      impulsive, doubtless affectionate. I could be relatively happy, marooned
      among a few hundred millions of yellow folk&mdash;though I could forego
      the missionaries. But you are likely, I should think, to be starved there.
      Spiritually&mdash;emotionally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; said she quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He thought it, over &ldquo;The life of a mission compound isn't exactly
      gay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you need gaiety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if I do. I haven't really faced it, of course. I'm not facing it
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just think a moment. You've not even landed in China yet. You're under no
      real restraint&mdash;still among white people, on a white man's ship,
      eating in European hotels at the ports. You aren't teaching endless
      lessons to yellow children, day in, day out. You aren't shut up in an
      interior city, where it mightn't even he safe for you to step outside the
      gate house alone. And yet you're breaking bounds. Right now&mdash;out here
      with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Already she was taking his curious bluntness for granted. She said now,
      simply, gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. I'm sitting out here at midnight with a married man. And I don't
      seem to mind. Of course you're not exactly married. Still... A few days
      ago I wouldn't have thought it possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you tell the Hasmers that you were out here last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you tell them about this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She thought a moment; then, as simply, repeated: &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. It's the way I feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. &ldquo;You feel it's none of their business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I ought to take you back, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't feel as if I were doing wrong. Oh, a little, but...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to take you back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rested a hand on his arm. It was no more than a girlish gesture. She
      didn't notice that he set his teeth and sat very still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've thought this, though,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If I'm to meet you out here like&mdash;like
      this&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you're not to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well... here we are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes... here we are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to say, it's dishonest, I think, for us to avoid each other
      during the day. If we're friends...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we're friends we'd better admit it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I meant that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fell to working at his pipe with a pocket knife She watched him until
      he was smoking again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Hasmer won't like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't help that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Of course.&rdquo; He smoked. Suddenly he broke out, with a gesture so
      vehement that it startled her: &ldquo;Oh, it's plain enough&mdash;we're on a
      ship, idling, dreaming, floating from a land of color and charm and quaint
      unreality to another land that has always enchanted me, for all the dirt
      and disease, and the smells. It's that! Romance! The old web! It's
      catching us. And we're not even resisting. No one could blame you&mdash;you're
      young, charming, as full of natural life as a young flower in the morning.
      But I... I'm not romantic. To-night, yes! But next Friday, in Shanghai,
      no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty turned away to hide a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think I'm brutal? Well&mdash;I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you're not brutal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am.... But my God! You in T'ainanfu! Child, it's wrong!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is simply a thing I can't help,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      They fell silent. The pulse of the great dim ship was soothing. One bell
      sounded. Two bells. Three.
    </p>
    <h3>
      3
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> man of Jonathan
      Brachey's nature couldn't know the power his nervous bold thoughts and
      words were bound to exert in the mind of a girl like Betty. In her heart
      already she was mothering him. Every word he spoke now, even the strong
      words that startled her, she enveloped in warm sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Brachey's crabbed, self-centered nature she was like a lush oasis in
      the arid desert of his heart. He could no more turn his back on it than
      could any tired, dusty wanderer. He knew this. Or, better, she was like a
      mirage. And mirages have driven men out of their wits.
    </p>
    <p>
      So romance seized them. They walked miles the next day, round and round
      the deck. Mrs. Hasmer was powerless, and perturbed. Her husband counseled
      watchful patience. Before night all the passengers knew that the two were
      restless apart. They found corners on the boat deck, far from all eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Mrs. Hasmer came to Betty's door; satisfied herself that the
      girl was actually undressing and going to bed. Not one personal word
      passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, half an hour later, Betty, dressed again, tiptoed out. Her heart
      was high, touched with divine recklessness. This, she supposed, was wrong;
      but right or wrong, it was carrying her out of her girlish self. She
      couldn't stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey was fighting harder; but to little purpose. They had these two
      days now. That was all. At Shanghai, and after, it would be, as he had so
      vigorously said, different. Just these two days! He saw, when she joined
      him on the deck, that she was riding at the two days as if they were to be
      her last on earth. Intensely, soberly happy, she was passing through a
      golden haze of dreams, leaving the future to be what it might.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat, hand in hand, in the bow. She sang, in a light pretty voice,
      songs of youth in a young land&mdash;college ditties, popular negro
      melodies, amusing little street songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very, very late, on the last evening, after a long silence&mdash;they had
      mounted to the boat deck&mdash;he caught her roughly in his arms and
      kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lay limply against him. For a moment, a bitter moment&mdash;for now,
      in an instant, he knew that she had never thought as far as this&mdash;he
      feared she had fainted. Then he felt her tears on his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted her to her feet, as roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She swayed away from him leaning against a boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said, choking:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you get down the steps all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bowed her head. He made no effort to help her down the steps. They
      walked along the deck toward the main companionway. Suddenly, with an
      inarticulate sound, he turned, plunged in at the smoking-room door, and
      was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the morning the ship dropped anchor in the muddy Woosung. The
      breakfast hour came around, then quarantine inspection; but the silent
      pale Betty, her moody eyes searching restlessly, caught no glimpse of him.
      He must have taken a later launch than the one that carried Betty and the
      Hasmers up to the Bund at Shanghai. And during their two days in the
      bizarre, polyglot city, with its European façade behind which swarms all
      China, it became clear that he wasn't stopping at the Astor House.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only letter was from her father at T'ainan-fu.
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched every mail; and inquired secretly at the office of the river
      steamers an hour before starting on the long voyage up the Yangtse; but
      there was nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she recalled that he had never asked for her address, or for her
      father's full name. They had spoken of T'ainan-fu. He might or might not
      remember it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that was all.

      CHAPTER III&mdash;THE SHEPHERD
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>T the point where
      the ancient highway, linking Northern China with Thibet, the Kukunor
      region and Mongolia, emerges from the treeless, red-brown tumbling hills
      of Hansi Province there stands across the road&mdash;or stood, before the
      revolution of 1911&mdash;a scenic arch of masonry crowned with a curving
      elaborately ornamented roof of tiles. Some forgotten philanthropist
      erected it, doubtless for a memorial to forgotten dead. Through this arch
      the west-bound traveler caught his first view of the wide yellow valley of
      the Han, with its yellow river, its square-walled, gray-green capital
      city, and, far beyond, of the sharp purple mountains that might have been
      cut out of cardboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gray of old T'ainan lay in the massive battle-mented walls and in the
      more than six square miles of closely packed tile roofs; the green in its
      thousands of trees. For here, as in Peking and Sian-fu they had preserved
      the trees; not, of course, in the innumerable tortuous streets, where
      petty merchants, money-changers, porters, coolies, beggars, soldiers and
      other riffraff passed freely through mud or dust, but within the thousands
      of hidden private courtyards, in the yamens of governor, treasurer, and
      provincial judge, in temple grounds outside the walls, and in the compound
      of the American Mission. At this latter spot, by the way, could be seen,
      with the aid of field-glasses, the only two-story residence in T'ainan;
      quite a European house, built after the French manner of red brick trimmed
      with white stone, and rising distinctly above the typically gray roofs
      that clustered about its lower windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were bold gate towers on the city wall; eight of them, great
      timbered structures with pagoda roofs rising perhaps fifteen yards above
      the wall and thirty above the lowly roadway. The timber-work under the
      shadowing eaves had sometime been painted in reds, blues and greens; and
      the once vivid colors, though dulled now by weather and years, were still
      richly visible to the near-observer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many smaller settlements, little gray clusters of houses, lay about the
      plain on radiating highways; for T'ainan boasted its suburbs. The hill
      slopes were dotted with the homes and walled gardens of bankers, merchants
      and other gentry. On a plateau just north of the Great Highway stood, side
      by side, two thirteen-roof pagodas, the pride of all central Hansi.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the city, on any day of the seven, twisting through the hundreds of
      little streets and in and out at the eight gates, moved tens of thousands
      of tirelessly busy folk, all clad in the faded blue cotton that spells
      China to the eye, and among these a slow-moving, never-ceasing tangle of
      wheeled and fourfooted local traffic.
    </p>
    <p>
      And along the Great Highway&mdash;down the hill slopes, through suburbs
      and city, over the river and on toward the teeming West; over the river,
      through city and suburbs and up the hills, toward the teeming East&mdash;flowed
      all day long the larger commerce that linked province with province and,
      ultimately, yellow man with white, at the treaty ports, hundreds of miles
      away. There were strings of laden camels with evil-looking Mongol drivers;
      hundreds and thousands of camels, disdainfully going and coming. There
      were hundreds and thousands of asses, patient little humorists, bearing
      panniers of coal lumps and iron ore from the crudely operated mines in the
      hills. There were hundreds and thousands of mule-drawn carts, springless,
      many with arched roofs of matting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the roadside, sheltered by little sagging canopies of grimy matting,
      or squatting in the dirt, were vendors of flat cakes and vinegary <i>sumshoo</i>
      and bits of this and that to wear. Naked children swarmed like flies in
      the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day-by-day life of the oldest and least selfconscious civilization in
      the world was moving quietly, resistlessly along, as it had moved for six
      thousand years.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>everend Henry B.
      Withery, on a morning in late March, came, by springless cart, out of
      Kansu into T'ainan. A drab little man, with patient fervor in his eyes and
      a limp (this latter the work of Boxers in 1900). He was bound, on leave,
      for Shanghai, San Francisco and home; but a night at T'ainan with Griggsby
      Doane meant, even in the light of hourly nearing America, much. For they
      had shared rooms at the seminary. They had entered the yielding yet
      resisting East side by side. Meeting but once or twice a year, even less
      often, they had felt each other deeply across the purple mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat through tiffin with the intent preoccupied workers in the
      dining-room of the brick house; and Mr Withery's gentle eyes took in
      rather shrewdly the curious household. It interested him. There were
      elements that puzzled him; a suggestion of staleness in this face, of
      nervous overstrain in that; a tension.
    </p>
    <p>
      The several native workers smiled and talked less, he thought, than on his
      former visits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Mr. Boatwright&mdash;slender, dustily blond, always hitherto
      burning with the tire of consecration&mdash;was continually fumbling with
      a spoon, or slowly twisting his tumbler, the while moodily studying the
      table-cloth. And his larger wife seemed heavier in mind as in body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Withery found the atmosphere even a little oppressive. He looked up
      about the comfortable, high ceiled room. Mounted and placed on the walls
      were a number of interesting specimens of wild fowl. Elmer Boatwright,
      though no devotee of slaughter or even of sport, had shot and mounted
      these himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Withery asked him now if he had found any interesting birds lately. The
      reply was little more than monosyllabic; it was almost the reply of a
      middle-aged man who has lost and forgotten the enthusiasm of youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was talk, of course; the casual surface chatter of folk who are
      deeply united in work. A new schoolroom was under construction. Jen Ling
      Pu, a native preacher, was doing well at So T'ung. The new tennis court
      wasn't, after all, long enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      During all this, Withery pondered. Griggsby was driving too hard, of
      course. The strongly ascetic nature of the man seemed to be telling on
      him; or perhaps it was running out, the fire of it, leaving only the force
      of will. That happened, of course, now and then, in the case of men gifted
      with great natural vitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then too, come to reflect on it, the fight had been hard, here in Hansi.
      Since 1900. Harder, perhaps, than anywhere else except Shantung and
      Chihli. Harder even than in those more easterly provinces, for they were
      nearer things. There were human contacts, freshening influences... . The
      Boxers had dealt heavily with the whites in Hansi. More than a hundred had
      been slain by fire or sword. Young women&mdash;girls like these two or
      three about the dinner table&mdash;had been tortured. Griggsby and his
      wife and the little girl had missed destruction only through the accident
      of a journey, in the spring, to Shanghai. And he had returned, dangerously
      early, to a smoldering ruin and plunged with all the vigor in his unusual
      body and mind at the task of reconstruction. The work in the province was
      shorthanded, of course, even yet. It would be so. But Griggsby was
      building it up. He even had the little so-called college, down the river
      at Hung Chan, going again, after a fashion. Money was needed, of course.
      And teachers. And equipment. All that had been discussed during tiffin. It
      was a rather heroic record. And it had not passed unobserved. At the
      Missionary Conference, at Shanghai, in 1906, Griggsby's report&mdash;carefully
      phrased, understated throughout, almost colorless&mdash;had drawn out
      unusual applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Doane's death occurred during the first year of that painful
      reconstruction. Griggsby's course, after that, from the day of the
      funeral, in fact, as you looked back over it, recalling this and that
      apparently trivial incident, was characteristic. The daughter was sent
      back to the States, for schooling. Griggsby furnished for himself, up in
      what was little more, really, than the attic of the new mission residence,
      a bare, severe little suite of bedroom and study. The newly married
      Boatwrights he installed, as something near master and mistress, on the
      second floor. The other white workers and teachers filled all but the two
      guest rooms, and, at times, even these. And then, his little institution
      organized on a wholly new footing, he had loaded himself sternly with
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was over. One by one the younger people left the room. And within a
      few moments the afternoon routine of the mission compound was under way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the open window came a beam of warm spring sunshine. Outside,
      across the wide courtyard Withery noted the, to him, familiar picture of
      two or three blue-clad Chinese men lounging on the steps of the gate
      house; students crossing, books in hand; young girls round and fresh of
      face, their slanting eyes demurely downcast, assembling before one of the
      buildings; two carpenters working deliberately on a scaffold. A
      soft-footed servant cleared the table. Now that the two friends were left
      free to chat of personal matters, the talk wandered into unexpectedly
      impersonal regions. Withery found himself baffled, and something puzzled.
      During each of their recent visits Griggsby's manner had affected him in
      this same way, but less definitely. The aloofness&mdash;he had once or
      twice ever, thought of it as an evasiveness&mdash;had been only a
      tendency. The old friendship had soon warmed through it and brought ease
      of spirit and tongue. But the tendency had grown. The present Griggsby was
      clearly going to prove harder to get at. That remoteness of manner had
      grown on him as a habit. The real man, whatever he was coming to be, was
      hidden now; the man whose very soul had once been written clear in the
      steady blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what a man he was! Mr. Withery indulged in a moment of sentiment as he
      quietly, shrewdly studied him, across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      In physical size, as in mental attainments and emotional force, James
      Griggsby Duane had been, from the beginning, a marked man. He was
      forty-five now; or within a year of it. The thick brown hair of their
      student days was thinner-now at the sides and nearly gone on top. But the
      big head was set on the solid shoulders with all the old distinction. A
      notable fact about Griggsby Doane was that after winning intercollegiate
      standing as a college football player, he had never allowed his body to
      settle back with the years. He weighed now, surely, within a pound or two
      or three of his playing weight twenty-four years earlier. He had always
      been what the British term a clean feeder, eating sparingly of simple
      food. Hardly a day of his life but had at least its hour or two of violent
      exercise. He would rise at five in the morning and run a few miles before
      breakfast. He played tennis and handball. He would gladly have boxed and
      wrestled, but a giant with nearly six and a half feet of trained,
      conditioned muscle at his disposal finds few to meet him, toe to toe. His
      passion for walking had really, during the earlier years, raised minor
      difficulties about T'ainan. The Chinese were intelligent and, of course,
      courteous; but it was more than they could be asked to understand at
      first.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had worked out, gradually. They knew him now; knew he was fearless,
      industrious, patient, kind. During the later years, after the Boxer
      trouble, his immense figure, striding like him of the fabled
      seven-league-boots, had become a familiar, friendly figure in central
      Hansi. Not infrequently he would tramp, pack on shoulders, from one to
      another of the outlying mission stations; and thought nothing of covering
      a hundred and thirty or forty <i>li</i> where your cart or litter mules or
      your Manchu pony would stop at ninety and call it a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Withery was bringing the talk around to the personal when Doane looked at
      his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll excuse me, Henry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I've a couple of classes. But I'll
      knock off about four-thirty. Make yourself comfortable. Prowl about. Use
      my study, if you like.... Or wait. We were speaking of the Ho Shan
      Company. They've had two or three mass meetings here during the winter,
      and got up some statements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they suggest violence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo; Doane waved the thought carelessly aside. &ldquo;But Pao will keep
      them in hand, I think. He doesn't want real trouble. But he wouldn't mind
      scaring the company into selling out. The gossip is that he is rather
      heavily interested himself in some of the native mines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Pao your governor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the governor died last fall, and no successor has been sent out.
      Kang, the treasurer, is nearly seventy and smokes sixty to a hundred pipes
      of opium a day. Pao Ting Chuan is provincial judge, but is ruling the
      province now. He's an able fellow.&rdquo;... Doane drew a thick lot of papers
      from an inner pocket, and selected one. &ldquo;Read this. It's one of their
      statements. Pao had the translation made in his yamen. I haven't the
      original, but the translation is fairly accurate I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Withery took the paper; ignored it, and studied his friend, who had moved
      to the door. Doane seemed to have lost his old smile&mdash;reflective,
      shrewd, a little quizzical. The furrow between his eyes had deepened into
      something near a permanent frown. There were fine lires about and under
      the eyes that might have indicated a deep weariness of the spirit. Yet the
      skin was clear, the color good.... Griggsby was fighting something out;
      alone; through the years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling this, Henry Withery broke out, in something of their old frank
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do knock off, Grigg. Let's have one of the old talks. I think&mdash;I
      think perhaps you need me a little.&rdquo; Doane hesitated. It was not like him
      to do that. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said gravely, but with his guard up, that curious
      guard, &ldquo;it would be fine to have one of the old talks if we can get at
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned to go; then paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, by the way, I'm expecting Pourmont. A little later in the day. He's
      resident engineer for the Ho Shan Company, over at Ping Yang. Pierre
      François George Marie Pourmont. An amusing person. He feels a good deal of
      concern over these meetings. For that matter, he was mobbed here in
      February. He didn't like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Withery found himself compressing his lips, and tried to correct that
      impulse with a rather artificial smile. It wasn't like Griggsby to speak
      in that light way. Like a society man almost. It suggested a hardening of
      the spirit; or a crust over deep sensitiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men, he reflected, who have to fight themselves during long periods of
      time are often hardened by the experience, even though they eventually
      win.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered, moving to the window, and thoughtfully watching the huge man
      striding across the courtyard, if Griggsby Doane would be winning.
    </p>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">U</span>p in the little
      study under the roof Mr. Withery sank into a Morris chair and settled back
      to read the views of the &ldquo;Gentry and People of Hansi&rdquo; on foreign mining
      syndicates. The documents had been typed on an old machine with an
      occasional broken letter; and were phrased in the quaint English that had
      long been familiar to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      First came a statement of the &ldquo;five items&rdquo; of difference between these
      &ldquo;Gentry and People&rdquo; and the Ho Shan Company&mdash;all of a technical or
      business nature. Only in the last &ldquo;item&rdquo; did the emotional reasoning
      common to Chinese public documents make its appearance.... &ldquo;<i>Five</i>.
      In Honan the company boldly introduced dynamite, which is prohibited. The
      dynamite exploded and this gave rise to diplomatic trouble, a like thing
      might happen in Hansi with the same evil consequences.&rdquo; Then followed this
      inevitable general statement:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At present in China, from the highest to the lowest, all are in
      difficulty&mdash;the annual for the indemnities amounts to Taels
      30,000,000, and in every province the reforms involve great additional
      expenditure, while the authorities only know how to control the
      expenditure, but not how to reach fresh sources of income. Those in power
      can find no fresh funds and the people are extremely poor and all they
      have to trust to are a few feet of land which have not been excavated by
      the foreigners. Westerners say that the coal of Hansi is sufficient to
      supply the needs of the world for two thousand years; in other countries
      there is coal without iron, or iron without coal, but in Hansi there is
      abundance of both coal and iron and it forms one of the best manufacturing
      countries in the world. At present if there is no protection for China
      then that finishes it, but if China is to be protected how can Hansi be
      excluded from protection? Therefore all China and all Hansi must withstand
      the claims of the Ho Shan Company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The company's agent general says that the agreement was drawn up with the
      Chinese Government, but at that time the people were unenlightened and
      traitors were suffered to effect stolen sales of Government lands, using
      oppression and disregarding the lives of the people. Now all the Gentry
      and People know how things are, and of what importance the consequences
      are for the lives of themselves and their families, and so with one heart
      they all withstand the company in whatever schemes it may have, for they
      are not willing to drop their hands and give themselves up to death, and
      if the officials will not protect the mines of Hansi then we will protect
      our mines ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We suggest a plan for the company, that it should state the sum used to
      bribe Hu Pin Chili, and to win over Chia Ching Jen and Liu O and Sheng
      Hsuan Hui and the Tsung Li Yamen, and the Wai Wu Pu and the Yu Chuan Pu,
      at the present time, and the bribes to other cruel traitors, and a
      detailed account of their expenditure in opening their mines since their
      arrival in China, and Hansi will repay the amount. If the company still
      pushes the claim for damages, in consequence of the delay in issuing the
      permit then the Hansi people will never submit to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In conclusion the people of Hansi must hold to their mines till death,
      and if the Government and officials still unrighteously flatter the
      foreigners in their oppression and flog the people robbing them of their
      flesh and blood to give those to the foreigners then some one must throw
      away his life by bomb throwing and so repay the company, but we trust the
      company will carefully consider and weigh the matter and not push Hansi to
      this extremity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Withery laid the documents on Doane's desk, and gave up an hour to
      jotting down notes for his own annual report. Then he took a long walk, in
      through the wall and about the inner city. He was back by four-thirty, but
      found no sign of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      At five a stout Frenchman arrived, a man of fifty or more, with a long,
      square-trimmed beard of which he was plainly fond. Doane returned then to
      the house.

      tea in the study. M. Pourmont, with an apology, smoked cigarettes. Withery
      observed, when the genual Frenchman turned his head, that the lobe of his
      left ear was missing.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Pourmont regarded the local situation seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zay spik of you,&rdquo; he explained to Griggsby Doane.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Zay say zat you have ze petit papier, ze little paper, all yellow, cut

     </p>
    <p>
      Doane merely considered this without replying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That statement of the Gentry and People looks rather serious to me,'' Mr.
      Withery remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has its serious side,&rdquo; said Doane quietly. &ldquo;Put you see, of course,
      from the frankness and publicity of it, that the officials are back of it.
      These Gentry and People would never go so far unsupported. It wouldn't
      surprise me to learn that the documents originated within the yamen of his
      Excellency Pao Ting Chuan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Withery. &ldquo;Put if he lets it drift much further the
      danger will be real. Suppose some young hothead were to take that last
      threat seriously and give up his life in throwing a bomb&mdash;-what
      then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be serious then, of course,&rdquo; said Doane. &ldquo;But I hardly think any
      one here would go so far unsupported.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; cried M. Pourmont, in some excitement, &ldquo;an' at who is it zat zay
      t'row ze bomb? It is at me, <i>n'est ce pas?</i> At me! You tlink I forget
      v'en ze mob it t'rowr ze <i>bierre</i> at me? <i>Mais non!</i> Zay tear ze

     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They attacked Monsieur Pourmont while he was riding to the yamen for an
      audience with Pao,&rdquo; Doane explained. &ldquo;But Pao heard of it and promptly
      sent soldiers. 1 took it up with him the next day. He acted most
      correctly. The ringleaders of the mob were whipped and imprisoned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you mus' also say to Monsieur Vitieree zat ze committee of my <i>compagnie</i>
      he come to Peking&mdash;<i>quinze mille kilometres he come!</i>&mdash;an'

     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all so, Henry.&rdquo; Thus Doane, turning to his friend. &ldquo;I don't mean
      to minimize the actual difficulties. But I do not believe we are in any
      such danger as in 1900. Even then the officials did it, of course. If they
      hadn't believed that the incantations of the Boxers made them immune to
      our bullets, and if they hadn't convinced the Empress Dowager of it, we
      should never have had the siege of the legations. But I am to have an
      audience with His Excellency tomorrow, at one, and will go over this
      ground carefully. I have no wish, myself, to underestimate the trouble. My
      daughter arrives next week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Withery. &ldquo;Oh... your daughter! From the States, Grigg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am to meet her at Hankow. The Hasmers brought her across.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's too bad, in a way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. But there was no choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But zat is not all zat is!&rdquo; M. Puurmont was pacing the floor now. &ldquo;A boy
      of me, of ze <i>cuisine</i>, he go home las' week to So T'ung an' he say
      zat a&mdash;vat you call?&mdash;a circle..
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A society?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mais oui!</i> A society, she meet in ze night an' <i>fait l'exercise</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are drilling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Oui!</i> Ze drill. It is ze society of Ze Great Eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard of that,&rdquo; mused Griggsby aloud. &ldquo;I don't really see what
      they can do. But I'll take it up to-morrow with, Pao. I would ask you,
      however, to remember that if the people don't know the cost of
      indemnities, there can be no doubt about Pao. He knows. And it is hard for
      me to imagine the province drifting out of his control for a single day.
      One event I am planning to watch closely is the fair here after the middle
      of April. Some of these agitators of the Gentry and People are sure to be
      on hand. We shall learn a great deal then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be back then, Grigg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. By the tenth. I shan't delay at all at Hankow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Henry Withery that his friend and host maneuvered to get him
      to retire first. Then he attributed the suspicion to his own disturbed
      thoughts.... Still, Griggsby hadn't returned to the house until after M.
      Pourmont's arrival. It was now nearly midnight, and there had been never a
      personal word.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at last, M. Pourmont out of the way for the night, lamp in hand,
      Griggsby led the way to the remaining guest room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Withery, following, looked up at the tall grave man, who had to stoop a
      little at the doors. Would Griggsby put down the lamp, speak a courteous
      good night, and go off to his own attic quarters; or would he linger? It
      was to be a test, this coming moment, of their friendship.... Withery's
      heart filled. In his way, through the years, out there in remote Kansu, he
      had always looked up to Grigg and had leaned on him, on memories of him as
      he had been. He had the memories now&mdash;curiously poignant memories,
      tinged with the melancholy of lost youth. But had he still the friend?
    </p>
    <p>
      Duane set down the lamp, and looked about, all grave courtesy, to see if
      his friend's bag was at hand, and if the wash-stand and towel-rack had
      been made ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      Withery stood on the sill, struggling to control his emotions.
      Longfellow's lines came to mind:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;A boy's will is the wind's will,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the thoughts of youth are long, long
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      thoughts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      They were middle-aged now, they two. It was extraordinarily hard to
      believe. They had felt so much, and shared so much. They had plunged at
      missionary work with such ardor. Grigg especially. He had thrown aside
      more than one early opportunity for a start in business. He had sacrificed
      useful worldly acquaintances. His heart had burned to save souls, to carry
      the flame of divine revelation into what had then seemed a benighted,
      materialistic land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grigg would have succeeded in business or in the service of his
      government. He had a marked administrative gift. And power.... Distinctly
      power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Withery stepped within the room, closed the door behind him, and looked
      straight up into that mask of a face; in his own deep emotion he thought
      of it as a tragic mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grigg,&rdquo; he said very simply, &ldquo;what's the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence. Then Doane came toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter?&rdquo; he queried, with an effort to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't we talk, Grigg?... I know you are in deep trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;Doane rested a massive hand on a bedpost&mdash;&ldquo;I won't say
      that it isn't an anxious time, Henry. I'm pinning my faith to Pau Ting
      Chuan. But... And, of course, if I could have foreseen all the little
      developments, I wouldn't have sent for Betty. Though it's not easy to see
      what else I could have done. Frank and Ethel couldn't keep her longer. And
      the expense of any other arrangement... She's nineteen, Henry. A young
      woman. Curious&mdash;a young woman whom I've never even seen as such, and
      my daughter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't that, Grigg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the moment Withery could say no more. He sank into a chair by the door,
      depressed in spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane walked to the window; looked out at the stars; drummed a moment on
      the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's been uphill work, Henry... since nineteen hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Withery cleared his throat. &ldquo;It isn't that,&rdquo; he repeated unsteadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane stood there a moment longer; then turned and gazed gloomily at his
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence grew painful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, Doane sighed, spread his hands in the manner of one who
      surrenders to fate, and came slowly over to the bed; stretching out his
      long frame there, against the pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it's as plain as that, Henry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is&mdash;to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if I can talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The question is, Grigg&mdash;can I help you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid not, Henry. I doubt if any one can.&rdquo; The force of this sank
      slowly into Withery's mind. &ldquo;No one?&rdquo; he asked in a hushed voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid not.... Do you think the others, my people here, see it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tone has changed here, Grigg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've tried not to believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've felt it increasingly for several years. When I've passed through.
      Even in your letters. It's been hard to speak before. For that matter, I
      had formulated no question. It was just an impression. But today... and
      to-night...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's as bad as that, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I say that it's as definite as that, Grigg. The impression.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane let his head drop back against the pillows; closed his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The words don't matter,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they don't, of course.&rdquo; Withery's mind, trained through the busy
      years to the sort of informal confessional familiar to priests of other
      than the Roman church, was clearing itself of the confusions of friendship
      and was ready to dismiss, for the time, philosophically; the sense of
      personal loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it something you've done, Grigg?&rdquo; he asked now, gently. &ldquo;Have you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane threw out an interrupting hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said rather shortly, &ldquo;I've not broken the faith, Henry, not in
      act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your thoughts only?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. There.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is doubt?... Strange, Grigg, I never knew a man whose faith had in it
      such vitality. You've inspired thousands. Tens of thousands. You&mdash;I
      will say this, now&mdash;you, nothing more, really, than my thoughts of
      you carried me through my bad time. Through those doldrums when the ardor
      of the first few years had burned out and I was spent, emotionally. It was
      with your help that I found my feet again. You never knew' that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I didn't know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I worried a good deal, then. I had never before been aware of the church
      as a worldly organization, as a political mechanism. I hadn't questioned
      it. It was Hidderleigh's shrewd campaign for the bishopric that disturbed
      me. Then the money raised questions, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's been a campaign on this winter, over in the States,&rdquo; said Doane,
      speaking slowly and thoughtfully. &ldquo;Part of that fund is to be sent here to
      help extend my work in the province. They're using all the old emotional
      devices. All the claptrap. Chaplain Cabell is touring the churches with
      his little cottage organ and his songs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the need is real out here, Grigg. And the people at home must be
      stirred into recognizing it. They can't he reached except through their
      emotions. I've been through all that. I see now, clearly enough, that it's
      an imperfect world. We must do the best we can with it. Because it is
      imperfect we must keep at our work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know as well as I what they're doing, Henry. Cabell, all that crowd,
      haven't once mentioned Hansi. They're talking the Congo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you forget, Grigg, that the emotional interest of our home people in
      China has run out. They thought about us during the Boxer trouble, and
      later, during the famine in Shensi. Now, because of the talk of slavery
      and atrocities in Central Africa, public interest has shifted to that part
      of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so they're playing on the public sympathy for Africa to raise money,
      some of which is later to be diverted to Central China.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else can they do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You find yourself inclined to question the whole process?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you misplacing your emphasis, Grigg? We all do that, of course.
      Now and then.... Isn't the important thing for you, the emphatic thing, to
      spread the word of God in Hansi Province?&rdquo; He leaned forward, speaking
      simply, with sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane closed his eyes again; and compressed his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Withery, anxiously watching him, saw that the healthy color was leaving
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a silence that grew steadily in intensity, Doane at last opened his
      eyes, and spoke, huskily, but with grim force.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, Henry, you're right. Right enough. These things are details.
      They're on my nerves, that's all. I'm going to tell you...&rdquo; He sat up,
      slowly swung his feet to the floor, clasped his hands.... &ldquo;I'll spare you
      my personal history of the past few years. And, of course, captious
      criticism of the church is no proper introduction to what I'm going to
      say. During these recent years I've been groping through my own
      Gethsemane. It has been a terrible time. There have been many moments when
      I've questioned the value of the struggle. If I had been as nearly alone
      as it has seemed, sometimes... I mean, if there hadn't been little Betty
      to think of...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; Withery murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a way I've come through my Valley. My head has cleared a little. And
      now I know only too clearly; it is very difficult; in a way, the time of
      doubt and groping was easier to bear... I know that I am in the wrong
      work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Withery, with moist eyes, studied the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sure?&rdquo; he managed to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt rather than saw his friend's slow nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a relief, of course, to tell you.&rdquo; Doane was speaking with less
      effort now; but his color had not returned. &ldquo;There's no one else. I
      couldn't say it to Hidderleigh. To me that man is fundamentally
      dishonest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Withery found it difficult to face such extreme frankness. His mind
      slipped around it into another channel. He was beginning to feel that
      Grigg mustn't be let off so easily. There were arguments....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing that has troubled me, even lately,&rdquo; he said, hunting for some
      common ground of thought and speech, &ldquo;is the old denominational
      differences back home. I can't take all that for granted, as so many of
      our younger workers do. It has seemed to me that the conference last year
      should have spoken out more vigorously on that one point. We can never
      bring missionary work into any sort of unity here while the denominational
      spirit is kept alive at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane broke out, with a touch of impatience: &ldquo;We approach the shrewdest,
      most keenly analytical people or; earth, the Chinese, with something near
      a hundred and fifty conflicting varieties of the one true religion. Too
      often, Henry, we try to pass to them our faith but actually succeed only
      in exhibiting the curious prejudices of narrow white minds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was, clearly, not a happy topic. Withery sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This&mdash;this attitude that you find yourself in&mdash;is really a
      conclusion, Grigg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a conclusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a calamity if you were to give up your work here, in the
      midst of reconstruction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No man is essential, Henry But of course, just now, it would lie
      difficult. I have thought, often, if Boatwright had only turned out a
      stronger man....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grigg, one thing! You must let me speak of it.... Has the possibility
      occurred to you of marrying again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane sprang up at this; walked the floor,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you realize what you're saying, Henry!&rdquo; he cried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand, Grigg, but you and I are old enough to know that in the
      case of a vigorous man like yourself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane threw out a hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry, I've thought of everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little later he stopped and stood over his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have fought battles that may as well be forgotten,&rdquo; he said
      deliberately. &ldquo;I have won them, over and over, to no end whatever. I have
      assumed that these victories would lead in time to a sort of peace, even
      to resignation. They have not. Each little victory now seems to leave me
      further back. I'm losing, not gaining, through the years. It was when I
      finally nerved myself to face that fact that I found myself facing it all&mdash;my
      whole life.... Henry, I'm full of a fire and energy that no longer finds
      an outlet in my work. I want to turn to new fields. If I don't, before
      it's too late, I may find myself on the rocks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Withery thought this over. Doane was still pacing the floor. Withery, pale
      himself now, looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you had better break with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane stopped at the window; stared out. Withery thought his face was
      working.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any means at all?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane moved his head in the negative.... &ldquo;Oh, my books. A few personal
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course&rdquo;&mdash;Withery's voice softened&mdash;&ldquo;you've given away a good
      deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've given everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum!... Have you thought of anything else you might do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane turned. &ldquo;Henry, I'm forty-five years old. I have no profession, no
      business experience beyond the little administrative work here. Yet I must
      live, not only for myself, but to support my little girl. If I do quit,
      and try to find a place in the business world, I shall carry to my grave
      the stigma that clings always to the unfrocked priest.&rdquo; He strode to the
      door. &ldquo;I tell you, I've thought of everything!... We're getting nowhere
      with this. I appreciate your interest. But... I'm sorry, Henry. Sleep if
      you can. Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They met, with M. Pourmont and the others, at breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment, on the steps of the gate house, overlooking the narrow
      busy street, when they silently clasped hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Henry Withery crawled in under the blue curtains of his cart and rode
      away, carrying with him a mental picture of a huge man, stooping a little
      under the red lintel of the doorway, his strong face sternly set.

      CHAPTER IV&mdash;THE RIDDLE OF LIFE, AND OF DEATH

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>OANE stood on the
      Bund at Hankow, by the railing, his great frame towering above the
      passers-by. He had lunched with the consul general, an old acquaintance.
      He had arranged to stop overnight, with Betty, in a missionary compound.
      In the morning they would take the weekly Peking Express northward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wide yellow Yangtse flowed by, between its steep mud cliffs, crowded
      with sampans&mdash;hundreds of them moored, rail to rail, against the
      opposite bank, a compact floating village that was cluttered and crowded
      with ragged river-folk and deck-houses of arched matting and that reared
      skyward a thick tangle of masts and rigging. The smaller boats and tubs of
      the water-beggars lay against the bank just beneath him, expectantly
      awaiting the Shanghai steamer. Out in the stream several stately junks lay
      at anchor; and near them a tiny river gunboat, her low free-board
      glistening white in the warm spring sunshine, a wisp of smoke trailing
      lazily from her funnel, the British ensign hanging ir folds astern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down and up the water steps were moving continuously the innumerable water
      bearers whose business it was to supply the city of near a million yellow
      folk that lay just behind the commercial buildings and the pyramid-like
      godowns of the Bund.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Doane the picture, every detail of which had a place in the environment
      of his entire adult life, seemed unreal. The consul general, too, had been
      unreal. His talk, mostly of remembered if partly mellowed political
      grievances back home, of the great days when a certain &ldquo;easy boss&rdquo; was in
      power, and later of the mutterings of revolution up and down the Yangtse
      Valley, sounded in Doane's ears like quaint idle chatter of another
      planet.... His own talk, it seemed now, had been as unreal as the rest of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the compliment men of affairs usually paid him, despite his calling, in
      speaking out as man to man, Doane had never thought and did not think now.
      He was not self-conscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hours of sober thought that followed his talk with Henry Withery had
      deepened the furrow between his brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an odd way he was dating from that talk. It had been extraordinarily
      futile. It had to come, some sort of outbreak. For two or three years he
      had rather vaguely recognized this fact, and as vaguely dreaded it. Now it
      had happened. It was like a line drawn squarely across his life. He was
      different now; perhaps more honest, certainly franker with himself, but
      different... It had shaken him. Sleep left him for a night or two. Getting
      away for this trip to Hankow seemed a good thing. He had to be alone,
      walking it off, and thinking... thinking.... He walked the two hundred and
      ninety <i>li</i> to M. Pour-mont's compound, at Ping Yang, the railhead
      that spring of the new meter-guage line into Hans' Province in two days.
      The mule teams took three.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dwelt much with memories of his daughter. She had been a winning little
      thing. Until the terrible Boxer year, that ended, for him, in the death of
      his wife, she had brought continuous happiness into their life.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would be six years older now. He couldn't picture that. She had sent
      an occasional snapshot photograph; but these could not replace his vivid
      memories of the child she had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was tremulously eager to see her. There would be little problems of
      adjustment. Over and over he told himself that he mustn't be stern with
      her; he must watch that.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt some uncertainty regarding her training. It was his hope that she
      would fit into the work of the mission. It seemed, indeed, necessary. She
      would be contributing eager young life. Her dutiful, rather perfunctory
      letters had made that much about her clear. They needed that.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the talk with Withery&mdash;it kept coming, up&mdash;he had heard
      his own voice saying&mdash;in curiously deliberate tones&mdash;astonishing
      things. He had sent his friend away in a state of deepest concern. He
      thought of writing him. A letter might catch him at Shanghai. There would
      be time in the morning, during the long early hours before this household
      down here would be awaking and gathering for breakfast. It would help, he
      felt impulsively, to explain fully... But what? What was it that was to be
      so easily explained? Could he erase, with a few strokes of a pen, the
      unhappy impression he had made that night on Henry's brain?
    </p>
    <p>
      The suggestion of marriage, with its implication of a rather cynical
      worldly wisdom, had come oddly from the devout Henry. Henry was older,
      too. But Doane winced at the mere recollection. He was almost excitedly
      sensitive on the topic. He had put women out of his mind, and was
      determined to keep them out. But at times thoughts of them slipped in.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the walk to Ping Yang, the second afternoon, he was swinging down a
      valley where the road was no more than the stony bed of an
      anciently-diverted stream. The caravan of a mandarin passed, bound
      doubtless from Peking to a far western province. That it was a great
      mandarin was indicated by his richly decorated sedan chair borne by
      sixteen footmen with squadrons of cavalry before and behind. Five mule
      litters followed, each with a brightly painted, young face pressed against
      the tiny square window, the wives or concubines of the great one. Each
      demurely studied him through slanting eyes. And the last one smiled;
      quickly, brightly. It was death to be caught at that, yet life was too
      strong for her. He walked feverishly after that. He had said one thing to
      Henry... something never before formulated, even in his own thinking. What
      was it? Oh, this!&mdash;&ldquo;Henry, I'm full of a fire and energy that no
      longer find an outlet in my work. I want to turn to new fields. If I
      don't, before it's too late, I may find myself on the rocks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something bitterly, if almost boyishly true in that statement.
      The vital, vigorous adult that was developing within him, now, in the
      forties, seemed almost unrelated to the young man he had been. He felt
      life, strength, power. In spirit he was younger than ever. All he had
      done, during more than twenty years, seemed but a practising for something
      real, a schooling. Now, standing there, a stern figure, on the Hankow
      Bund, he was aware of a developed, flowering instinct for the main
      currents of the mighty social stream, for rough, fresh contacts, large
      enterprises. His religion had been steadily widening out from the creed of
      his youth, gradually including all living things, all growth, far
      outspreading the set boundaries of churchly thought. This development of
      his spirit had immensely widened his spiritual influence among the Chinese
      of the province while at the same time making it increasingly different to
      talk frankly with fellow churchmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had come to find more of the bread of life in Emerson and Montaigne,
      Chaucer and Shakespeare; less in Milton and Peter. He could consider Burns
      now with a new pity, without moral condescension, with simple love. He
      could feel profoundly the moral triumph of Hester Prynne, while wondering
      at what seemed his own logic. He struggled against a weakening faith in
      the authenticity of divine revelation, as against a deepening perception
      that the Confucian precepts might well be a healthy and even sufficient
      outgrowth of fundamental Chinese characteristics.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought, at times rather grimly, of the trials for heresy that now and
      then rocked the church; and wondered, as grimly, how soon the heresy
      hunters would be getting around to him. The smallest incident might,
      sooner or later would, set them after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Withery was certain, in spite of his personal loyalty, out of his
      very concern, to drop a word. And there was literally no word he could
      drop, after their talk, but would indicate potential heresy in his friend,
      James Griggsby Doane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or it might come from within the compound. Or from a passing stranger. Or
      from remarks of his own at the annual conference. Or from letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were moments when he could have invited exposure as a relief from
      doubt and torment of soul. There was nothing of the hypocrite in him. But
      in soberer moments he felt certain that it was letter to wait until he
      could find, if not divine guidance, at least an intelligent earthly plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      All he could do, as it stood, was to work harder and harder with body and
      mind. And to shoulder more and more responsibility. Without that he would
      be like a wild engine, charging to destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      His daughter would be, for a time certainly, one more burden. He was glad.
      Anything that would bring life real again! Work above all; every waking
      moment, if possible, filled; his mental and physical powers taxed to their
      uttermost; that was the thing; crowd out the brooding, the mere feeling.
      Action, all the time, and hard, objective thought. The difficulty was that
      his powers were so great; he seemed never to tire any more; his thoughts
      could dwell on many planes at once; he actually needed but a few hours'
      sleep.... And so Betty would be a young woman now, mysteriously as old as
      her mother on her wedding day: a young woman of unknown interests and
      sympathies, of a world he himself had all but ceased to know. And it came
      upon him suddenly, then with tremendous emotional force, that he had no
      heritage to leave her but a good name.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood gripping the railing, head back, gazing up out of misty eyes at a
      white-flecked blue sky. A prayer arose from his heart and, a whisper,
      passed his lips: &ldquo;O God, show me Thy truth, that it may set me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the intensity of his brooding he had forgotten to watch for the
      steamer. But now he became aware of a stir of life along the river-front.
      The beggars were paddling out into the stream, making ready their little
      baskets at the ends of bamboo poles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the cliffs, down-stream, hung a long film of smoke. The steamer had
      rounded the bend and was plowing rapidly up toward the twin cities. He
      could make out the two white stripes on the funnel, and the cluster of
      ventilators about it, and the new canvas across the front of the bridge. A
      moment later he could see the tiny figures crowding the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steamer warped in alongside a new wharf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane stood near the gangway, all emotion, nearly out of control.
    </p>
    <p>
      From below hundreds of coolies, countrymen and ragged soldiers swarmed up,
      to be herded off at one side of the wharf. The local coolies went aboard
      and promptly started unloading freight, handling crates and bales of half
      a ton weight with the quick, half grunted, half sung chanteys, intricately
      rhythmical, with which all heavy labor is accompanied in the Yangtse
      Valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two spectacled Chinese merchants in shimmering silk robes came down the
      gangway. A tall American, in civilian dress and overcoat but carrying a
      leather sword case, followed. Two missionaries came, one in Chinese dress
      with a cue attached to his skull-cap, bowing to the stern giant as they
      passed. Then a French father in black robe and shovel hat; a group of
      Englishmen; a number of families, American, British, French; and finally,
      coming along the shaded deck, the familiar kindly face and silvery heard
      of Doctor Hasmer&mdash;he was distinctly growing older, Hasmer&mdash;then
      his wife, and, emerging from the cabin, a slim little figure, rather
      smartly dressed, extraordinarily pretty, radiating a quick charm as she
      hurried to the gangway, there pausing a moment to search the wharf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes met his. She smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Betty. He felt her charm, but his heart was sinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      She kissed him. She seemed all enthusiasm, even very happy. But a moment
      later, walking along the wharf toward the Bund, her soft little face was
      sad. He wondered, as his thoughts whirled around, about that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her clothes, her beauty, her bright manner, indicating a girlish eagerness
      to be admired, wouldn't do at the mission. And she couldn't wear those
      trim little shoes with heels half an inch higher than a man's.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had, definitely, the gift and the thought of adorning herself. She was
      a good girl; there was stuff in her. But it wouldn't do; not out there in
      T'ainan. And she looked like anything in the world but a teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      She fascinated him. She was the lovely creature his own little girl had
      become. Walking beside her up the Bund, chatting with the Hasmers, making
      a fair show of calm, his heart swelled with love and pride. She was
      delicate, shyly adorable, gently feminine.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was going to be difficult to speak about her costume and her charming
      ways. It wouldn't do to crush her. She was quick enough; very likely she
      would pick up the tone of the compound very quickly and adapt herself to
      it.
    </p>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>oung Li Hsien, of
      T'ainan had come up on the boat. Doans talked a moment with him on the
      wharf. He was taking the Peking Express in the morning, traveling
      first-class. The boy's father was a wealthy banker and had always been
      generous with his firstborn son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Li appeared in the dining-car at noon, calmly smiling, and, at Doane's
      imitation, sat with him and Betty. He carried a copy of <i>Thus Spake
      Zarathustra</i>, in English, with a large number of protruding paper
      bookmarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane glanced in some surprise at the volume lying rather ostentatiously
      on the table, and then at the pigtailed young man who ate foreign food
      with an eagerness and a relish that indicated an excited interest in novel
      experiment not commonly found among his race.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked in Chinese. Li had much to say of the Japanese. He admired
      them for adopting and adapting to their own purposes the material
      achievements of the Western world. He had evidently heard something of
      Theodore Roosevelt and rather less of Lloyd George and Karl Marx. Doane
      was of the opinion, later, that during the tiffin hour the lad had told
      all he had learned in six months at Tokio. When asked why he was not
      finishing out his college year he smiled enigmatically and spoke of duties
      at home. He knew, of course, that Doane would instantly dismiss the reason
      as meaningless; it was his Chinese way of suggesting that he preferred not
      to answer the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty-four hours later they transferred their luggage to the Hansi Line,
      and headed westward into the red hills; passing, within an hour, through
      the southern extension of the Great Wall, now a ruin. The night was passed
      in M. Pourmont's compound at Ping Yang. After this there were two other
      nights in ancient, unpleasant village inns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Duane made every effort to lessen the discomforts of the journey.
      Outwardly kind, inwardly emotions fought with one another. He felt now
      that he should never have sent for Betty; never in the world She seemed to
      have had no practical training. She grew quiet and wistful as the journey
      proceeded. The little outbreaks of enthusiasm over this or that
      half-remembered glimpse of native life came less frequently from day to
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were a number of young men at Ping Yang; one French engineer who
      spoke excellent English; an Australian; others, and two or three young
      matrons who had adventurously accompanied their husbands into the
      interior. They all called in the evening. The hospitable Pourmont took up
      rugs and turned on the talking-machine, and the young people danced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane sat apart, watched the gracefully gliding couples; tried to smile.
      The dance was on, Betty in the thick of it, before he realized what was
      meant. He couldn't have spoken without others hearing. It was plain enough
      that she entered into it without a thought; though as the evening wore on
      he thought she glanced at him, now and then, rather thoughtfully. And he
      found himself, at these moments, smiling with greater determination and
      nodding at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The incident plunged him, curiously, swiftly, into the heart of his own
      dilemma. He rested an elbow on a table and shaded his eyes, trying, as he
      had been trying all these years, to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a joyous little thing she was! What a fairy! And dancing seemed, now,
      a means of expression for her youth and her gift of charm. And there was
      an exquisite delight, he found, in watching her skill with the young men.
      She was gay, quick, tactful. Clearly young men had, before this, admired
      her. He wondered what sort of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted this brooding with one of those slightly perturbed
      glances. Quickly he lowered his hand in order that she might see him
      smile; but she had whirled away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joy!... Not before this moment, not in all the years of puzzled, sometimes
      bitter thinking, had he realized the degree in which mission life&mdash;for
      that matter, the very religion of his denominational variety&mdash;shut
      joy out. They were afraid of it. They fought it. In their hearts they
      associated it with vice It was of this world; their eyes were turned
      wholly to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      His teeth grated together. The muscles of his strong jaws moved; bunched
      on his cheeks. He knew now that he believed in joy as an expression of
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he known where to turn for the money he would gladly have planned, at
      this moment, to send Betty back to the States, give her more of an
      education, even arrange for her to study drawing and painting. For on the
      train, during their silences, she had sketched the French conductor, the
      French-speaking Chinese porter, the sleepy, gray-brown, walled villages,
      the wide, desert-like flats of the Hoang-Ho, the tumbling hills. He was
      struck by her persistence at it; the girlish energy she put into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, late, long after the music had stopped and the last guests had
      left for their dwellings about the large compound, she came across the
      corridor and tapped at his door. She wore a kimono of Japan; her abundant
      brown hair rippled about her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just one more good night, Daddy,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, turning away, she added this, softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought about the dancing until&mdash;well, we'd started...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood a long moment in silence, then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you had a pleasant evening, dear. We&mdash;we're rather quiet at
      T'ainan.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>ao Ting Chuan was
      a man of great shrewdness and considerable distinction of appearance,
      skilled in ceremonial intercourse, a master of the intricate courses a
      prominent official must steer between beautifully phrased moral and
      ethical maxims on the one hand and complicated political trickery on the
      other. But, as Doane had said, he knew the cost of indemnities. It was on
      his shrewdness, his really great intelligence, and on his firm control of
      the &ldquo;gentry and people&rdquo; of the province that Doane relied to prevent any
      such frightful slaughter of whites and destruction of their property as
      had occurred in 1900. Pao, unlike most of the higher mandarins, was
      Chinese, not Manchu.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tao-tai of the city of T'ainan-fu, Chang Chih Ting, was an older man
      than Pao, less vigorous of body and mind, simpler and franker. He was of
      those who bewail the backwardness of China.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the tao-tai's yamen, on the first day of the great April fair, set
      forth His Excellency in full panoply of state&mdash;a green official chair
      with many bearers, an escort of twenty footmen, with runners on ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind this caravan, hidden from view in the depths of a blue Peking cart,
      with the conventional extra servant dangling his heels over the foreboard,
      rode Griggsby Doane.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal feature of the opening day was a theatrical performance. The
      play, naturally, was an historical satire, shouted and occasionally sung
      by the heavily-costumed actors, to a continuous accompaniment of wailing
      strings. The stage was a platform in the open air, under a tree hung with
      bannerets inscribed to the particular spirit supposed to dwell within its
      encircling bark.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Excellency stood, with Doane, on a knoll, looking out over the heads
      of the vast audience toward the stage. Doane estimated the attendance at
      near ten thousand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The play, begun in the early morning, was now well advanced. At its
      conclusion, the audience was beginning to break up when a slim blue-clad
      figure mounted the platform and began a hurried speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chang and Doane looked at each other; then as one man moved forward down
      the knoll with the throng. The tao-tai's attendants followed, in scattered
      formation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The speaker was Li Hsien.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the magistrate and the missionary made their way toward the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first the crowd, at sight of the magistrate's button and embroidered
      insignia, made way as well as they could. But as the impassioned phrases
      of Li Hsien sank into their minds resistance developed. From here and
      there in the crowd came phrases expressing a vile contempt for foreigners
      such as Doane had not heard for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Li was lashing himself up, crying out more and more vigorously against the
      Ho Shan Company, the barbarous white governments from which it derived
      force, foreign pigs everywhere. The crowds closed, solidly, before the two
      advancing men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magistrate waved his arms; shouted a command that Li leave the
      platform. Li, hearing only a voice of opposition in the crowd, poured out
      voluble scorn on his head. The crowd jostled Duane. A stick struck his
      cheek. He whirled and caught the stick, but the wielder of it escaped in
      the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chang tried to reason, then, with the few hundred within ear-shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sense of violence seemed to be increasing. A few of the magistrate's
      escort were struggling through. These formed a circle about him and Doane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Li shouted out charge after charge against the company. He begged his
      hearers to be brave, as he was brave; to destroy all the works of the
      company with dynamite; to wreck all the grounds of the foreign engineer at
      Ping Yang and kill all the occupants; to kill foreigners everywhere and
      assert the ancient integrity and superiority of China. &ldquo;Be brave!&rdquo; he
      cried again. &ldquo;See, I am brave. I die for Hansi. Can not you, too, die for
      Hansi? Can not you think of me, of how I died for our cause, and yourself,
      in memory of my act, fight for your beloved country, that it may again be
      the proud queen of the earth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew a revolver from his sleeve; shot twice; fell to the stage in a
      widening pool of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      At once the vast crowd went wild. Those near the white man turned on him
      as if to kill him. His clothes were torn, his head cut. Man after man he
      knocked down with his powerful fists. Before many moments he was exulting
      in the struggle, in his strength and the full use of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magistrate, struggled beside him. For the people. In their frenzy,
      forgot or ignored his rank and overwhelmed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The runners fought as well as they could. Two or three of them fell. Then
      a body of horsemen came charging into the crowd, soldiers from the judge's
      yamen, all on shaggy little Manchu ponies, swinging clubbed carbines as
      they rode. Right and left, men and boys fell. The crowd broke and
      scattered.

    <p>
      Chang, bleeding from several small wounds, his exquisitely embroidered
      silken garments torn nearly off his body, made his way back to the green
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane was escorted by soldiers to the mission compound. He slipped in to
      wash off the blood and change his clothes without being seen by Betty or
      any of the whites.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly came two runners of His Excellency, Pao Ting Chuan, bearing trays
      of gifts. And a Chinese note expressing deepest regret and pledging
      complete protection in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane dismissed the runners with a Mexican dollar each, and thoughtfully
      considered the situation. Pao was strong, very strong. Yet the
      self-destruction of Li Hsien would act as a flaming signal to the people
      It was the one appeal that might rouse them beyond control.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE Boatwrights
      were at this time in the thirties; he perhaps thirty-six or seven, she
      thirty-three or four. As has already been noted through the observing eyes
      of Mr. Withery, Elmer Boatwright had lost the fresh enthusiasm of his
      first years in the province. And he had by no means attained the mellow
      wisdom that seldom so much as begins to appear in a man before forty. His
      was a daily routine of innumerable petty tasks and responsibilities. He
      had come to be a washed-out little man, whose unceasing activity was
      somehow unconvincing. He had stopped having opinions, even views. He
      taught, he kept accounts and records, he conducted meetings, he prayed and
      sometimes preached at meetings of the students and the native Christians,
      he was kind in a routine way, his rather patient smile was liked about the
      compound, but the gift of personality was not his. Even his religion
      seemed at times to have settled into routine....
    </p>
    <p>
      He was small in stature, not plump, with light thin hair and a light thin
      mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife was taller than he, more vigorous, more positive, with something
      of an executive gift. The domestic management of the compound was her
      province, with teaching in spare hours. Her husband, with fewer petty
      activities to absorb his energy until his life settled into a mold, might
      have exhibited some of the interesting emotional quality that is rather
      loosely called temperament; for that matter it was still a possibility
      during the soul-shaking changes of middle life; certainly his odd, early
      taste for taxidermy had carried him to the borders of a sort of artistry;
      but her own gift was distinctly that of activity. She seemed a wholly
      objective person. She was physically strong, inclined to sternness, or at
      least to rigidity of view, yet was by no means unkind. The servants
      respected her. She was troubled by no doubts. Her religious faith, like
      her housekeeping practise, was a settled thing. Apparently her thinking
      was all of the literal things about her. Of humor she had never shown a
      trace. Without the strong proselyting impetus that had directed and
      colored her life she might have become a rather hard, sharp-tongued
      village housewife. But at whatever cost to herself she had brought her
      tongue under control. As a result, having no mental lightness or grace,
      she talked hardly at all. When she disapproved, which was not seldom, she
      became silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The relation between this couple and Griggsby Doane had grown subtly
      complicated through the years that followed the death of Mrs. Doane.
      Doane, up in his simply furnished attic room, living wholly alone, never
      interfered in the slightest detail of Mrs. Boatwright's management. Like
      her, when he disapproved, he kept still. But he might as well have spoken
      out, for she knew, nearly always, what he was thinking. The deepest
      blunder she made during this period was to believe, as she firmly did,
      that she knew all, instead of nearly all his thoughts. The side of him
      that she was incapable of understanding, the intensely, warmly human side,
      appeared to her merely as a curiously inexplicable strain of weakness in
      him that might, some day, crop out and make trouble. She felt a strain of
      something disastrous in his nature. She regarded his growing passion for
      solitude as a form of self-indulgence. She knew that he was given more and
      more to brooding; and brooding&mdash;all independent thought, in fact&mdash;alarmed
      her. Her own deepest faith was in what she thought of as submission to
      divine will and in self-suppression. But she respected him profoundly. And
      he respected her. Each knew something of the strength in the other's
      nature. And so they lived on from day to day and year to year in a
      practised avoidance of conflict or controversy. And between them her busy
      little husband acted as a buffer without ever becoming aware that a buffer
      was necessary in this quiet, well-ordered, industrious compound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding the change of tone for the more severe and the worse that had
      impressed and disturbed Withery, none of the three but Duane had
      formulated a conscious thought. Probably the less kindly air was really
      more congenial to Mrs. Boatwright. Her husband was not a man ever to
      survey himself and his environment with detachment. And both were much
      older and more severe at this time than they were to be at fifty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The introduction of Betty Doane into this delicately balanced household
      precipitated a crisis. Breakfast was served in the mission house at a
      quarter to eight. Not once in a month was it five minutes late. A delay of
      half an hour would have thrown Mrs. Boatwright out of her stride for the
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first few days after her arrival Betty appeared on time. It was
      clearly necessary. Mrs. Boatwright was hostile. Her father was busy and
      preoccupied. She herself was moved deeply by a girlish determination to
      find some small niche for herself in this driving little community. The
      place was strange to her. There seemed little or no companionship. Even
      Miss Hemphill, the head teacher, whom she remembered from her girlhood,
      and Dr. Mary Cassin, who was in charge of the dispensary and who had a
      pleasant, almost pretty face, seemed as preoccupied as Griggsby Doane.
      During her mother's lifetime there had been an air of friendliness, of
      kindness, about the compound that was gone now. Perhaps less work had been
      accomplished then than now under the firm rule of Mrs. Boatwright, but it
      had been a happier little community.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment she rode in through the great oak, nail-studded gates of
      the compound, and the mules lurched to their knees, and her father helped
      her out through the little side door of the red and blue litter, Betty
      knew that she was exciting disapproval. The way they looked at her neat
      traveling suit, her becoming turban, her shoes, worked sharply on her
      sensitive young nerves. She was aware even of the prim way they walked,
      these women&mdash;of their extremely modest self-control&mdash;and of the
      puzzling contrast set up with the free activity of her own slim body;
      developed by dancing and basketball and healthy romping into a grace that
      had hitherto been unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      And almost from that first moment, herself hardly aware of what she was
      about but feeling that she must be wrong, struggling bravely against an
      increasing hurt, her unrooted, nervously responsive young nature struggled
      to adapt itself to the new environment. A pucker appeared between her
      brows; her voice became hushed and faintly, shyly earnest in tone. Mrs.
      Boatwright at once gave her some classes of young girls. Betty went to
      Miss Hemphill for detailed advice, and earnestly that first evening read
      into a work on pedagogics that the older teacher, after a kindly enough
      talk, lent her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went up to her father's study, just before bedtime on the first
      evening, in a spirit of determined good humor. She wanted him to see how
      well she was taking hold.... But she came down in a state of depression
      that kept her awake for a long time lying in her narrow iron bed, gazing
      out into the starlit Chinese heavens. She felt his grave kindness, but
      found that she didn't know him. Here in the compound, with all his burden
      of responsibility settled on his broad shoulders, he had receded from her.
      He would sit and look at her, with sadness in his eyes, not catching all
      she said; then would start a little, and smile, and take her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found that she couldn't unpack all her things; not for days. There
      were snapshots of boy and girl members of &ldquo;the crowd,&rdquo; away off there,
      beyond the brown hills, beyond the ruined wall, beyond the yellow plains,
      and the Pacific Ocean and the wide United States, off in a little New
      Jersey town, on the other side of the world. There were parcels of dance
      programs, with little white pencils dangling from silken white cords.
      There were programs of plays, with cryptic pencilings, and copies of a
      high-school paper, and packets of letters. She couldn't trust herself to
      look at these treasures. And she put her drawing things away.
    </p>
    <p>
      And other more serious difficulties arose to provoke sober thoughts. One
      occurred the first time she played tennis with her father; the day before
      Li Hsien's suicide. The court had been laid out on open ground adjoining
      the compound. Small school buildings and a wall shut it off from the front
      street, and a Chinese house-wall blocked the other end; but the farther
      side lay open to a narrow footway. Here a number of Chinese youths
      gathered and watched the play. It happened that none of the white women
      attached to the mission at this time was a tennis player; and the
      spectacle of a radiant girl darting about with grace and zest and
      considerable athletic skill was plainly an experience to the onlookers. At
      first they were respectful enough; but as their numbers grew voices were
      raised, first in laughter, then in unpleasant comment. Finally all the
      voices seemed to burst out at once in chorus of ribaldry and invective.
      Betty stopped short in her play, alarmed and confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      These shouted remarks grew in insolence. All through her girlhood Betty
      had grown accustomed to occasional small outbreaks from the riff-raff of
      T'ainan. She recalled that her father had always chosen to ignore them.
      But there was a new boldness evident in the present group, as the numbers
      increased and more and more voices joined in. And it was evident, from an
      embroidered robe here and there, that not all were riff-raff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father lowered his racket and walked to the net.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry, dear,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but this won't do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Obediently she returned to the mission house; while Doane went over to the
      fence. But before he could reach it the youths, jeering, hurried away.
      That evening he told Betty he would have a wall built along the footway.
    </p>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ithin less than a
      week Betty found herself fighting off a heart-sickness that was to prove,
      for the time, irresistible. On the sixth evening, after the house had
      became still and her big, kind father had said good night&mdash;in some
      ways, at moments, he seemed almost close to her; at other moments,
      especially now, at night, in the solitude, he was hopelessly far away, a
      dim figure on the farther shore of the gulf that lies, bottomless, between
      every two human souls&mdash;she locked herself in her little room and sat,
      very still, with drooping face and wet eyes, by the open window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The big Oriental city was silent, asleep, except for the distant sound of
      a watchman banging his gong and shouting musically on his rounds. The
      spring air, soft, moistly warm, brought to her nostrils the smell of
      China; and brought with it, queerly disjointed, hauntlike memories of her
      childhood in the earlier mission house that had stood on this same bit of
      ground. She closed her eyes, and saw her mother walking in quiet dignity
      about the compound, the same compound in which Luella Brenty, a girl of
      hardly more than her-own present age, was, in 1900, burned at the stake.
      Down there where the ghostly tablet stood, by the chapel steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shivered. There was trouble now. They were talking about it among
      themselves, if not in her presence. That would doubtless explain her
      father's preoccupation.... She must hurry to bed. She knew she was tired;
      and it wouldn't do to be late for breakfast. And she had a class in
      English at 8:45.
    </p>
    <p>
      But instead she got out the bottom tray of her trunk and mournfully
      staring long at each, went through her photographs. She had been a nice
      girl, there in the comfortable American town. Here she seemed less nice.
      As if, in some way, over there in the States, her nature had changed for
      the worse. They looked at her so. They were not friendly. No, not that.
      Yet this was home, her only home. The other had seemed to be home, but it
      was now a dream... gone. She could never again pick up her place in the
      old crowd. It would be changing. That, she thought, in the brooding
      reverie known to every imaginative, sensitive boy and girl, was the sad
      thing about life. It slipped away from you; you could nowhere put your
      feet down solidly. If, another year, she could return, the crowd would be
      changed. New friendships would be formed. The boys who had been fond of
      her would now be fond of others. Some of the girls might be married... She
      herself was changed. A man&mdash;an older man, who had been married, was,
      in a way, married at the time&mdash;-had taken her in his arms and kissed
      her. It w'as a shock. It hurt now. She couldn't think how it had happened,
      how it had ever begun. She couldn't even visualize the man, now, with her
      eyes closed. She couldn't be sure even that she liked him. He was a
      strange being. He had interested her by startling her. Romance had seized
      them. He said that. He said it would be different at Shanghai. It was
      different; very puzzling, saddening. There was no doubt as to what Mrs.
      Boatwright would say about it, if she knew. Or Miss Hemphill. Any of
      them.... She wondered what her father would say. She couldn't tel! him. It
      had to be secret. There were things in life that had to be; but she
      wondered what he would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was, with herself, here in her solitude, honest about it. It had
      happened. She didn't blame the man. In his strange way, he was real. He
      had meant it. She had read his letter over and over, on the steamer, and
      here in T'ainan. It was moving, exciting to her that odd letter. And he
      had gone without a further word because he felt it to be the best way. She
      was sure of that.... She didn't blame herself, though it hurt. No, she
      couldn't blame him. Yet it was now, as it had been at the time, a sort of
      blinding, almost an unnerving shock.... Probably they would never meet
      again. It was a large world, after all; you couldn't go back and pick up
      dropped threads. But if they should meet, by some queer chance, what would
      they do, what could they say? For he lingered vividly with her; his rough
      blunt phrases came up, at lonely moments, in her mind. He had stirred and,
      queerly, bewilderingly, humbled her.... She wondered, all nerves, what his
      wife was like. How she looked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was this change in her that these severe women noticed. Perhaps
      her inner life lay open to their experienced eyes. She could do nothing
      about it, just set her teeth and live through somehow.... Though it
      couldn't be wholly that, because she had worn the clothes they didn't like
      before it happened, and had danced, and played like a child. And they
      didn't seem to care much for her drawing; though Miss Hemphill had, she
      knew, suggested to Mr. Boatwright that he let her try teaching a small
      class of the Chinese girls.... No, it wasn't that. It must, then, be
      something in her nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had read, back home&mdash;or in the States&mdash;in a woman's
      magazine, that every woman has two men in her life, the one she loves, or
      who has stirred her, and the one she marries. The girls, in some
      excitement, had discussed it. There had been confidences.
    </p>
    <p>
      She might marry. It was possible. And even now she saw clearly enough, as
      every girl sees when life presses, that marriage might, at any moment,
      present itself as a way out. The thought was not stimulating. The pictures
      it raised lacked the glowing color of her younger and more romantic
      dreams.... That mining engineer was writing her, from Korea. His name was
      Apgar, Harold B. Apgar; he was stocky, strong, with an attractive square
      face and quiet gray eyes. She liked him. But his letters were going to be
      hard to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soft air that fanned her softer cheek brought utter melancholy. She
      felt, as only the young can feel, that her life, with her merry youth, was
      over. Grim doors had closed on it. Joy lay behind those doors. Ahead lay
      duties, discipline, the somber routine of womanhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shivered and stirred. This brooding wouldn't do.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got out a pad of paper and a pencil, and sitting there in the dim
      light, sketched with deft fingers the roofs and trees of T'ainan, as they
      appeared in the moonlight of spring, with a great faint gate tower bulking
      high above a battlemented wall. Until far into the morning she drew,
      forgetful of the hours, finding a degree of melancholy pleasure in the
      exercise of the expressive faculty that had become second nature to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slept, then, like a child, until mid-forenoon. It was nearly eleven
      o'clock when she hurried, ready to smile quickly to cover her confusion,
      down to the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breakfast things had been cleared away more than two hours earlier.
      The table boy (so said the cook) had gone to market. She ate, rather
      shamefaced, a little bread and butter (she was finding it difficult to get
      used to this tinned butter from New Zealand).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the parlor Mrs. Boatwright sat at her desk. She heard Betty at the
      door, lifted her head for a cool bow, then resumed her work. Not a word
      did she speak or invite. There was an apology trembling on the tip of
      Betty's tongue, but she had to hold it back and turn away.
    </p>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he day after the
      suicide of Li Hsien rumors began to drift into the compound. News travels
      swiftly in China. The table &ldquo;boy&rdquo; (a man of fifty-odd) brought interesting
      bits from the market, always a center for gossip of the city and the
      mid-provincial region about it. The old gate-keeper, Sun Shao-i, picked up
      much of the roadside talk. And the several other men helpers about the
      compound each contributed his bit. The act of the fanatical student had,
      at the start, as Doane anticipated, an electrical effect on public
      sentiment. Suicide is by no means generally regarded in China as a sign of
      failure. It is employed, at times of great stress, as a form of deliberate
      protest; and is then taken as heroism.
    </p>
    <p>
      So reports came that the always existent hatred of foreigners was rising,
      and might get out of control. A French priest was murdered on the Kalgan
      highway, after protracted torture during which his eyes and tongue were
      fed to village dogs. This, doubtless, as retaliation for similar practises
      commonly attributed to the white missionaries. The fact that the local
      Shen magistrate promptly caught and beheaded a few of the ringleaders
      appeared to have small deterrent effect on public feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Detachments of strange-appearing soldiers, wearing curious insignia, were
      marching into the province over the Western Mountains. A native worker at
      one of the mission outposts wrote that they broke into his compound and
      robbed him of food, but made little further trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reports bearing on the activities of the new Great Eye Society&mdash;already
      known along the wayside as &ldquo;The Lookers&rdquo;&mdash;were coming in daily. The
      Lookers were initiating many young men into their strange magic, which
      appeared to differ from the incantations of the Boxers of 1900 more in
      detail than in spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the western, villages this element was welcoming the new soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here in T'ainan disorder was increasing. An old native, helper of Dr.
      Cassin in the dispensary, was mobbed on the street and given a beating
      during which his arm was broken. He managed to walk to the compound, and
      was now about with the arm in a sling, working quietly as usual. But it
      was evident that native Christians must, as usual in times of trouble,
      suffer for their faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following afternoon the tao-tai called, in state, with bearers,
      runners, soldiers and secretaries. The main courtyard of the compound was
      filled with the richly colored chairs and the silks and satins and plumed
      ceremonial hats of his entourage. For more than an hour he was closeted
      with Griggsby Doane, while the Chinese schoolgirls, very demure, stole
      glances from curtained windows at the beautiful young men in the
      courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this impressive visit, and by his long stay, Chang Chih Ting clearly
      meant to impress on the whole city his friendship for these foreign
      devils. For the whole city would know of it within an hour; all middle
      Hansi would know by nightfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      He brought disturbing news. It had been obvious to Doane that the menacing
      new society could hardly spread and thrive without some sort of secret
      official backing. He was inclined to trust Chang. He believed, after days
      of balancing the subtle pros and cons in his mind, that Pao Ting Chuan
      would keep order. And he knew that the official who was responsible for
      the province&mdash;as Pao virtually was&mdash;could keep order if he
      chose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chang, always naively open with Doane, supported him in this view. But it
      was strongly rumored at the tao-tai's yamen that the treasurer, Kang Hsu,
      old as he was, weakened by opium, for the past two or three years an
      inconsiderable figure in the province, had lately been in correspondence
      with the Western soldiers. And officers from his yamen had been recognized
      as among the drill masters of the Looker bands. Chang had reported these
      proceedings to His Excellency, he said (&ldquo;His Excellency,&rdquo; during this
      period, meant always Pao, though Kang Hsu, as treasurer, ranked him) and
      had been graciously thanked. It was also said that Kang had cured himself
      of opium smoking by locking himself in a room and throwing pipe, rods,
      lamp and all his supply of the drug out of a window. For two weeks he had
      suffered painfully, and had nearly died of a diarrhea; but now had
      recovered and was even gaining in weight, though still a skeleton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane caught himself shaking his head, with Chang, over this remarkable
      self-cure. It would apparently be better for the whites were Kang to
      resume his evil ways. It was clear to these deeply experienced men that
      Kang's motives would be mixed. Doubtless he had been stirred to jealousy
      by Pao. It seemed unlikely that he, or any prominent mandarin, could
      afford to run the great risks involved in setting the province afire so
      soon after 1900. Perhaps he knew a way to lay the fresh troubles at Pao's
      gate. Or perhaps he had come to believe, with his befuddled old brain, in
      the Looker incantations. Only seven years earlier the belief of ruling
      Manchus in Boxer magic had led to the siege of the legations and something
      near the ruin of China. Come to think of it, Kang, unlike Pao and Chang,
      was a Manchu.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chang also brought with him a copy of the Memorial left by Li Hsien, which
      it appeared was being widely circulated in the province. The document gave
      an interesting picture of the young man's complicated mind. His death had
      been theatrical and, in manner, Western, modern. Suicides of protest were
      traditionally managed in private. But the memorial was utterly Chinese,
      written with all the customary indirection, dwelling on his devotion to
      his parents and his native land, as on his own worthlessness; quoting apt
      phrases from Confucius, Mencius and Tseng Tzu; quite, indeed, in the best
      traditional manner. And he left a letter to his elder brother, couched in
      language humble and tender, giving exact directions for his funeral, down
      to the arrangement of his clothing and the precise amount to be paid to
      the Taoist priest, together with instructions as to the disposition of his
      small personal estate. Doane pointed out that these documents were
      designed to impress on the gentry his loyal conformity to ancient
      tradition, while his motives were revolutionary and his final act was
      designed to excite the mob at the fair and folk of their class throughout
      the province. Chang believed he had scholarly help in preparing the
      documents. And both men felt it of sober significance that the memorial
      was addressed to &ldquo;His Excellency, Kang Hsu, Provincial Treasurer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That Li Hsien's inflammatory denunciation of &ldquo;the foreign engineer at Ping
      Yang&rdquo; had an almost immediate effect was indicated by the news from that
      village at the railhead. M. Puurmont wrote, in French, that an Australian
      stake-boy had been shot through the lungs while helping an instrument man
      in the hills. He was alive, but barely so, at the time of writing. As a
      result of this and certain lesser difficulties, M. Pourmont was calling in
      his engineers and mine employees, and putting them to work improvising a
      fort about his compound, and had telegraphed Peking for a large shipment
      of tinned food. He added that there would be plenty of room in case Doane
      later should decide to gather in his outpost workers and fall back toward
      the railroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane translated this letter into Chinese for Chang's benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he firearms?&rdquo; asked the tao-tai.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane inclined his head. &ldquo;More than the treaty permits,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;He
      told me last winter that he thought it necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is as well,&rdquo; said Chang. &ldquo;Though it is not necessary for you to leave
      yet. To do that would be to invite misunderstanding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would invite attack,&rdquo; said Doane.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the morning after Chang's call that the telegram came from Jen
      Ling Pu. Doane was crossing the courtyard when he heard voices in the gate
      house; then Sun Shao-i came down the steps and gave him the message. He at
      once sent a chit to Pao, writing it in pencil against a wall; then ordered
      a cart brought around. Within an hour the boy was back. Pao had written on
      the margin of the note: &ldquo;Will see you immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For once the great mandarin did not keep him waiting. The two inner gates
      of the yamen opened for him one after the other, and his cart was driven
      across the tiled inner court to the yamen porch. It was an unheard-of
      honor. Plainly, Pao, like the lesser Chang, purposed standing by his guns,
      and meant that the city should know. By way of emphasis, Pao himself,
      tall, stately, magnificent in his richly embroidered robe, the peacock
      emblem of a civil mandarin of the third-class embroidered on the breast,
      the girdle clasp of worked gold, wearing the round hat of office crowned
      with a large round ruby&mdash;Pao, deep and musical of voice, met him in
      the shadowy porch and conducted him to the reception room. Instantly the
      tea appeared, and they could talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Excellency,&rdquo; said Doane, &ldquo;a Christian worker in So T'ung, one Jen
      Ling Pu, telegraphs me that strange soldiers, helped by members of the
      Great Eye Society, last night attacked his compound. They have burned the
      gate house, but have no firearms. At eight this morning, with the aid of
      the engineer for the Ho Shan Company in that region, and with only two
      revolvers, he was defending the compound. I am going there. I will leave
      this noon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear your alarming words with profound regret,&rdquo; Pao's deep voice rolled
      about the large high room. &ldquo;My people are suffering under an excitement
      which causes them to forget their responsibility as neighbors and their
      duty to their fellow men. I will send soldiers with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soldiers should be sent, Your Excellency, and at once. Well-armed men.
      But I shall not wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going alone? And not in your usual manner, on foot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Your Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that may be unsafe.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My safety is of little consequence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is of great consequence to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For that I thank you. But it is to So T'ung a hundred and eighty <i>li</i>.
      The best mules or horses will need two days. I can walk there in less than
      one day. I have walked there in twenty hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a man of courage. I will order the soldiers to start by noon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Back at the compound, Doane assembled his staff in one of the schoolrooms.
      Mr. and Mrs. Boatwright were there, Miss Hemphill and Dr. Cassin. He laid
      the telegram before them, and repeated his conversation with the
      provincial judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      They listened soberly. For a brief time one spoke. Then Mrs. Boatwright
      asked, bluntly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sure you ought to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane inclined his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If things are as bad as this, how about our safety here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be protected. Both Pao and Chang will see to that. And in case
      of serious danger&mdash;something unforeseen, you must demand an escort to
      Ping Yang. You will be safe there with Monsieur Pourmont.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about your own safety?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have put the responsibility squarely on Pao's shoulders. He knows what
      I am going to do. He is sending soldiers after me. He will undoubtedly
      telegraph ahead; he'll have to do that.&rdquo;
     </p>

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>etty was in his
      study, standing by the window. She turned quickly when he came in. He
      closed the door, and affecting a casual manner passed her with a smile and
      went into the bedroom for the light bag with a shoulder strap, the blanket
      roll and the ingenious light folding cot that he always carried on these
      expeditions if there was likelihood of his being caught overnight at
      native inns. He put on his walking boots and leggings, picked up his thin
      raincoat and the heavy stick that was his only weapon, and returned to the
      study.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt Betty's eyes on him, and tried to speak in an offhand manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm off to So T'ung, Betty. Be back within two or three days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came over, slowly, hesitating, and lingered the blanket roll.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will there he danger at So T'ung, Dad?&rdquo; she asked gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very little, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw that neither his words nor his manner answered the questions in her
      hind. Patting her shoulder, he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me good-by, child. You've been listening to the chatter of the
      compound. The worst place for gossip in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she laid a light finger on the court-plaster that covered a cut on his
      cheek-bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never said a word about that, Dad. It was the riot at the fair. I
      know. You had to fight with them. And Li Hsien killed himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But His Excellency put down the trouble at once. That is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sank slowly into the swivel chair before the desk; dropped her cheek
      on her hand; said, in a low uneven voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one talks to me... tells me...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked down at her, standing motionless. His eyes filled. Then,
      deliberately, he put his park aside, and seated himself at the other side
      of the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up, with a wistful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not afraid, Dad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn't be,&rdquo; said he gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But there is trouble, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. There is trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it will be as&mdash;as bad as&mdash;nineteen hundred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No... no, I'm sure it won't. The officials simply can't afford to let
      that awful thing happen again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be... well, discouraging,&rdquo; said she thoughtfully. &ldquo;Wouldn't it?
      To have all your work undone again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He found himself startled by her impersonal manner. He saw her, abruptly
      then, as a mature being. He didn't know how to talk to her. This
      thoughtful young woman was, curiously, a stranger.... And this was the
      first moment in which it had occurred to him that she might already have
      had beginning adult experience. She was an individual; had a life of her
      own to manage. There would have been men. She was old enough to have
      thought about marriage, even. It seemed incredible.... He sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're worried about me,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't have brought you out here, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't fit in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a great change for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I... I'm no good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty, dear&mdash;that is not true. I can't let you say that, or think
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's the truth. I'm no good. I've tried. I have, Dad. You know, to
      put everything behind me and make myself take hold.... And then I draw
      half the night, and miss my classes in the morning. It seems to go against
      my nature, some way. No matter how hard I try, it doesn't work. The worst
      of it is, in my heart I know it isn't going to work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't have brought you out here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you couldn't help that, Dad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It did seem so.... I'm planning now to send you back as soon as we can
      manage it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Dad... the expense...!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. I am thinking about that. There will surely be a way to manage
      it, a little later. I mean to find a way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can't go back to Uncle Frank's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must work it out so that it won't be a burden to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean... pay board?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But think, Dad! I've cost you so much already!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you have, dear. I think I've needed that. And I want you to go
      back to the Art League. You have a real talent. We must make the most of
      it.&rdquo; Betty's gaze strayed out the window. Her father was a dear man. She
      hadn't dreamed he could see into her problems like this. She was afraid
      she might cry, so she spoke quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that means making me still more a burden!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the sort of burden 1 would love, Betty. But don't misunderstand me&mdash;I
      can't do all this now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may have to be patient for a time. Tell me, dear, first though... is
      it what you want most?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh... why...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer me if you can. If you know what you want most.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if I do know. It's when I try to think that out clearly that it
      seems to me I'm no good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I recognize, of course, that you are reaching the age when many girls
      think of marrying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I... oh...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to intrude into your intimate thoughts, dear. But in so far
      as we can plan together... it may help if...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke with a touch of reserve that might have been, probably was,
      shyness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There have been men, of course, who&mdash;-well, wanted to marry me. This
      last year. There was one in New York. He used to come out and take me
      riding in his automobile. I&mdash;I always made some of the other girls
      come with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane found it impossible to visualize this picture. When he was last in
      the States there were no automobiles on the streets. It suggested a
      condition of which he knew literally nothing, a wholly new set of
      influences in the life of young people. The thought was alarming; he had
      to close his eyes on it for a moment. Much as his daughter had seemed like
      a visitor from another planet, she had never seemed so far off as now. And
      he fell to thinking, along with this new picture, of the terribly hard
      struggle they had had out here, since 1900, in rebuilding the mission
      organization, in training new workers and creating a new morale. He felt
      tired.... His brain was tired. It would help to get out on the road again,
      swinging gradually into the rhythm of his forty-inch stride. Once more he
      would walk himself off, even as he hastened on an errand of rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty was speaking again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there's one now. He's in Korea, a mining engineer. He's awfully nice.
      But I&mdash;I don't think I could marry him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you love him, Betty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N&mdash;no. No, I don't. Though I've wondered, sometimes, about these
      things....&rdquo; The person she was wondering about, as she said this, was
      Jonathan Brachey. Suddenly, with her mind's eye, she saw this clearly. And
      it was startling. She couldn't so much as mention his name; certainly not
      to her father, kind and human as he seemed. But she would never hear from
      him again; not now. If he could live through those first few weeks without
      so much as writing, he could let the years go. That would have been the
      test for her sort of nature, and she could understand no other sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      She compressed her lips. She didn't know that her face showed something of
      the trouble in her mind. She spoke, bravely, with an abruptness that
      surprised herself a little, as it surprised him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Dad, I shan't marry. Not for years, if ever. I'd rather work. I'd
      rather work hard, if only I could fit in somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm seeing it a little more clearly, Betty.&rdquo;' He arose. &ldquo;On the way out
      I'll tell Mrs. Boatwright and Miss Hemphill both that I don't want you to
      do any more work about the compound.... No, dear, please! Let me
      finish!... When you're a few years older, you'll learn as I have learned,
      that the important thing is to find your own work, and find it early. So
      many lives take the wrong direction, through mistaken judgment, or a
      mistaken sense of duty. And nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;can so mislead us
      as a sense of duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said this with an emphasis that puzzled Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thing for you,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;is to draw. And dream. The dreaming will
      work out in more drawing, I imagine. For you have the nature of the
      artist. Your mother had it. You are like her, with something of my energy
      added. Don't let the atmosphere of the compound pull you down. It mustn't
      do that. Live within yourself. Let your energy go into honest expression
      of yourself. You see what I'm getting at&mdash;<i>be</i> yourself. Don't
      try to be some one else.... You happen to be here in an interesting time.
      There's a possibility that the drawings you could make out here, now,
      would have a value later on. So try to make a record of your life here
      with your pencil. And don't be afraid of happiness, dear.&rdquo; He pointed to a
      row of jonquils in a window-box. &ldquo;Happiness is as great a contribution to
      life as duty. Think how those flowers contribute! And remember that you
      are like them to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She clung to him, in impulsive affection, as she kissed him good-by. And
      it wasn't until late that night, as she lay in her white bed, such a glow
      did he leave in her warm little heart, that the odd nature of his talk
      caught her attention. She had never, never, heard him say such things. It
      was as if he, her great strong dad, were himself starved for happiness. As
      if he wanted her to have all the rich beauty of life that had passed him
      grimly by.
    </p>
    <p>
      She fell to wondering, sleepily, what he meant by finding a way to get the
      money. There was no way. Though it was dear of him even to think of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She fell asleep then.

      short of sixty-five English miles. The road was little more than a
      footpath, so narrow that in the mountains, where the grinding of ages of
      traffic and the drainage from eroded slopes had long ago worn it down into
      a series of deep, narrow canyons, the came! trains, with their wide
      panniers, always found passing a matter of difficulty and confusion. Here
      it skirted a precipice, or twisted up and up to surmount the Pass of the
      Flighting Geese, just west of the sacred mountain; there it wandered along
      the lower hillsides above a spring torrent that would be, a few months
      later, a trickling rivulet. His gait averaged, over all conditions of road
      and of gradient, about five miles an hour. He followed, on this occasion,
      the principle of walking an hour, then resting fifteen minutes. And toward
      midnight he set up his cot by the roadside, in the shelter of a tree by a
      memorial arch, and gave himself two hours of sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little hill city of So T'ung was awake and astir, with gates open and
      traffic already flowing forth. There were no signs of disorder. But Doane
      noted that the anti-foreign mutterings and sneers along the roadside (to
      which he had grown accustomed twenty years earlier) were louder and more
      frequent than common. For himself he had not the slightest fear. His great
      height, his enormous strength, his commanding eye, had always, except on
      the one recent occasion of the riot at the T'ainan fair, been enough to
      cow any native who was near enough to do him injury. And added to this
      moral and physical strength he had lately felt a somewhat surprising
      recklessness. He felt this now. He didn't care what happened, so long as
      he might be busy in the thick of it. His personal safety took on
      importance only when he kept Betty in mind. He must save himself to
      provide for her. And, of course, in the absence of any other strong
      personality, the mission workers needed him; they had no one else, just
      now, on whom to lean. And then there were the hundreds of native
      Christians; they needed him, for they would be slaughtered first... if it
      should come to that. They would be loyal, and would die, at the last, for
      their faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the long hours of walking through the still mountain night, his
      thoughts ranged far. He considered talking over his problems with M.
      Pourmont. There should be work for a strong, well-trained man somewhere in
      the railroad development that was going on all over the yellow kingdom.
      Preferably in some other region, where he wouldn't be known. Starting
      fresh, that was the thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Over and over the rather blank thought came around, that a man has no
      right to bring into the world a child for whom he can not properly, fully,
      care. And it came down to money, to some money; not as wealth, but as the
      one usable medium of human exchange. A little of it, honestly earned,
      meant that a man was productive, was paying his way. A saying of Emerson's
      shot in among his racing thoughts&mdash;something about clergymen always
      demanding a handicap. It was wrong, he felt. It was&mdash;he went as far
      as this, toward dawn&mdash;parasitic. A man, to live soundly, healthily,
      must shoulder his way among his fellows, prove himself squarely.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he dwelt for hours at a time on the ethical basis of all this
      missionary activity. It was what he came around to all night. There was an
      assumption&mdash;it was, really, the assumption on which his present life
      was based&mdash;that the so-called Christian civilization, Western Europe
      and America&mdash;owed its superiority to what he thought of as the
      Christian consciousness. That superiority was always implied. It was the
      motive power back of this persistent proselytizing. But to-night, as
      increasingly of late years, he found himself whittling away the
      implications of a spiritual and even ethical quality in that superiority
      of the White over the Yellow. More and more clearly it seemed to come down
      to the physical. It was the amazing discoveries in what men call modern
      science, and the wide application in industry of these discoveries, that
      made much of the difference. Then there were the accidents of climate and
      soil and of certain happy mixtures of blood through conquests... these
      things made a people great or weak. And lesser accidents, such as a simple
      alphabet, making it easy and cheap to print ideas; the Chinese alphabet
      and the lack of easy transportation had held China back, he believed....
      Back of all these matters lay, of course, a more powerful determinant; the
      genius that might be waxing or waning in a people. The genius of America
      was waxing, clearly; and the genius of China had been waning for six
      hundred years. But in her turn, China had waxed, as had Rome, and Greece,
      and Egypt. None of these had known the Christian consciousness, yet each
      had run her course. And Greece and Rome, without it, had risen high. Rome,
      indeed, whatever the reason, had begun to wane from the very dawn of
      Christianity; and had finally succumbed, not to that, but to barbarians
      who had in them crude physical health and enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more deeply he pondered, the more was he inclined to question the
      importance of Christianity in the Western scheme. For Western
      civilization, to his burning eyes, walking at night, alone, over the hills
      of ancient Hansi, looked of a profoundly materialistic nature. You felt
      that, out here, where oil and cigarettes and foreign-made opium and
      merchandise of all sorts were pushing in, all the time, about and beyond
      the missionaries. And with bayonets always bristling in the background.
      The West hadn't the finely great gift of Greece or the splendid unity of
      Rome. Its art was little more than a confusion of copies, a library of
      historical essays. And art seemed, now, important. And as for religion...
      Doane had moments of real bitterness, that night, about religion. And he
      thought around and around a circle. The one strongest, best organized
      church of the West&mdash;the one that made itself felt most effectively in
      China&mdash;seemed to him not only opposed to the scientific enterprise
      that was, if anything, peculiarly the genius of the West, but insistent on
      superstitions (for so they looked, out here) beside which the quiet
      rationalism of the Confucian drift seemed very reality. And the period of
      the greatest power and glory of that church had been, to all European
      civilization, the Dark Ages. The Reformation and the modern free political
      spirit appeared to be cognates, yet the evangelical churches fought
      science, in their turn, from their firm base of divine revelation. It was
      difficult, to-night, to see the miracles and mysteries of Christianity as
      other than legendary superstitions handed down by primitive, credulous
      peoples. It was difficult to see them as greatly different from the
      incantations of the Boxers or of these newer Lookers.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, of all those great peoples that had waxed and waned, China alone
      remained.... There was a thought! She might wax again. For there she was,
      as always. Without the Christian consciousness, the Chinese, of all the
      great peoples, alone had endured.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fact slightly puzzling to Doane was that he thought all this under a
      driving nervous pressure. Now and then his mind rushed him, got a little
      out of control. And at these times he walked too fast.
    </p>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he mission station
      was situated in the northern suburbs of So T'ung-fu, outside the wall.
      Duane went directly there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mission compound lay a smoking ruin. Not a building of the five or six
      that had stood in the walled acre, was now more than a heap of bricks,
      with a Ft of wall or a chimney standing. The compound wall had been
      battered down at a number of points, apparently with a heavy timber that
      now lay outside one of the breaches. There was no sign of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked in among the ruins. They were still too hot for close
      examination. But he found the body of a white man lying in an open space,
      clad in flannel shirt and riding breeches, with knee-high laced boots of
      the sort commonly worn by engineers. The face was unrecognizable. The top
      of the head, too, had been beaten in. But on the back of the head grew'
      curly yellow' hair. From the figure evidently a young man; one of
      Pourmont's adventurous crew; probably one of the Australians or New
      Zealanders. A revolver lay near the outstretched hand. Doane picked it up
      and examined it. Every chamber was empty. And here and there along the
      path were empty cartridges; as if he had retreated stubbornly, loading and
      firing as he could. Not far off lay an empty cartridge box. That would be
      where he had filled for the last time. He must have sent some of the
      bullets home; but the attackers had removed their dead. Yes, closer
      scrutiny discovered a number of blood-soaked areas along the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young Chinese joined him, announcing himself as a helper at the station.
      Jen Ling Pu had sent him out over the rear wall, he said, with the
      telegram to Mr. Doa ne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together they carried the body of the white man to a clear space near the
      wall and buried him in a shallow grave. Duane repeated the burial service
      in brief form.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy, whose name was Wen, explained that on his return from the
      telegraph station he had found it impossible to get into the compound, as
      it was then surrounded, and accordingly hid in the neighborhood. By that
      time, he said, Jen, with the three or four helpers and servants who had
      not perished in the other buildings, one or two native Bible-women, a few
      children of native Christians and the white man were all in the main
      house, and were firing through the windows. They had all undoubtedly been
      burned to death, as only the white man had come out. He himself could not
      get close enough to see much of what happened, though he slipped in among
      the curious crowd outside and picked up what information he could. The
      attacking parlies were by no means of one mind or of settled purpose. The
      Lookers among them were for a quick and complete massacre, as were the
      young rowdies who had joined in the attack for the fun of it. But there
      were more moderate councils. And so many were injured or killed by the
      accurate marksmanship of the young foreign devil, that for a time they all
      seemed to lose heart. The Lookers were subjected to ridicule by the crowd
      because by their incantations they were supposed to render themselves
      invisible to foreign eyes, and it was difficult to explain the high
      percentage of casualties among them on the grounds of accidental contact
      with flying bullets. Finally a ruse was decided on. The white man was to
      come out for a parley. A student, recently attached to the yamen of the
      local magistrate as an interpreter volunteered&mdash;in good faith, Wen
      believed&mdash;to act in that capacity on this occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting took place by one of the breaches in the wall. The engineer
      demanded that the three principal leaders of the Lookers Le surrendered to
      him on the spot, and held until the arrival of troops from T'ainan. While
      they were pretending to listen, a party crept around behind the wall. He
      heard them, stepped back in time to avoid being clubbed to death, in a
      moment shot two of them dead, and shot also the captain of the Lookers,
      who had been conducting the parley. Then, evidently, he had backed tow ard
      the main house and had nearly reached it when his cartridges gave out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane was busy, what with the improvised burial and with noting down Wen's
      narrative, until nearly noon. By this time he was very sleepy. There was
      nothing more he could do. The ruins of the main house would not be cool
      before morning. Nor would the soldiers arrive. He decided to call at once
      on the magistrate and arrange for a guard to be left in charge of the
      compound; then to set up his cot in a cell in one of the local
      caravansaries. He had brought a little food, and the magistrate would give
      him what else he needed. The innkeeper would brew him tea.... Before two
      o'clock he was asleep.
    </p>
    <h3>
      3
    </h3>
    <p>
      He was awakened by a persistent light tapping at the door. Lying there in
      the dusky room, fully clad, gazing out under heavy lids at the dingy wall
      with its dingier banners hung about lettered with the Chinese characters
      for happiness and prosperity, and at the tattered gray paper squares
      through which came soft evening sounds of mules and asses munching their
      fodder at the long open manger, of children talking, of a carter singing
      to himself in quavering falsetto, it seemed to him that the knocking had
      been going on for a very long time. His thoughts, slowly coming awake,
      were of tragic stuff. Death stalked again the hills of Hansi. Friends had
      been butchered. The blood of his race had been spilled again. Life was a
      grim thing....
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice called, in pidgin-English.
    </p>
    <p>
      He replied gruffly; sat up; struck a match and lighted the rush-light on
      the table. It was just after eight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the door; opened it. A small, soft, yellow Chinaman stood
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; Doane asked in Chinese.
    </p>
    <p>
      The yellow man looked blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My no savvy,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What side you belong?&rdquo; The familiar pidgin-English phrases sounded
      grotesquely in Doane's ears, even as they fell from his own lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My belong Shanghai side,&rdquo; explained the man. He was apparently a servant.
      Some one would have brought him out here. Though to what end it would be
      hard to guess, for a servant who can not make himself understood has small
      value. And no Shanghai man can do that in Hansi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What pidgin belong you this side?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My missy wanchee chin-chin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus the man. His mistress wished a word. It was odd. Who, what, would his
      mistress be!
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane always made it a rule, in these caravansaries, to engage the &ldquo;number
      one&rdquo; room if it was to be had. A countryside inn, in China, is usually a
      walled rectangle of something less or more than a halfacre in extent.
      Across the front stands the innkeeper's house, and the immense, roofed,
      swinging gates, built of strong timbers and planks. Along one side wall
      extend the stables, where the animals stand a row, looking over the manger
      into the courtyard. Along the other side are cell-like rooms, usually on
      the same level as the ground, with floors of dirt or worn old tile, with a
      table, a narrow chair or two of bent wood, and the inevitable brick <i>kang</i>,
      or platform bed with a tiny charcoal stove built into it and a thickness
      or two of matting thrown over the dirt and insect life of the crumbling
      surface. At the end of the court opposite' the gate stands, nearly always,
      a small separate building, the floor raised two or three steps from the
      ground. This is, in the pidgin vernacular, the &ldquo;number one&rdquo; room. Usually,
      however, it is large enough for division into two or three rooms. In the
      present instance there were two rather large rooms on either side of an
      entrance hall. Doane had been ushered into one of these rooms with no
      thought for the possible occupant of the other, beyond sleepily noting
      that the door was closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hastily brushing his hair and smoothing the wrinkles out of his coat he
      stepped across the hall. That other door was ajar now. He tapped; and a
      woman's voice, a voice not unpleasing in quality, cried, in English, &ldquo;Come
      in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>he rose, as he
      pushed open the door, from the chair. She was young&mdash;certainly in the
      twenties&mdash;and unexpectedly, curiously beautiful. Her voice was
      Western American. Her abundant hair wras a vivid yellow. She was clad in a
      rather elaborate negligee robe that looked odd in the dingy room. Her cot
      stood by the paper windows, on a square of new white matting. Two
      suit-cases stood on bricks nearer the <i>kang.</i> And a garment was
      tacked up across the broken paper squares.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry to trouble you,&rdquo; she said breathlessly. &ldquo;But it's getting
      unbearable. I've waited here ever since yesterday for some word. I know
      there was trouble. I heard so much shooting. And they made such a racket
      yelling. They got into the compound here. I had to cover my windows, you
      see. It was awful. All night I thought they'd murder me. And this morning
      I slept a little in the chair. And then you came in... I saw you... and I
      was wild to ask you the news. I thought perhaps you'd help me. I've sat
      here for hours, trying to keep from disturbing you. I knew you were
      sleeping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ran on in an ungoverned, oddly intimate way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad to be of what service I&mdash;&rdquo; He found himself saying
      something or other; wondering with a strangely cold mind what he could
      possibly do and why on earth she was here. His own long pent-up emotional
      nature was answering hers with profoundly disturbing force.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to ask you to sit down,&rdquo; she was saying. She caught his arm and
      almost forced him into the chair. She even stroked his shoulder, nervously
      yet casually. He coldly told himself that he must keep steady, impersonal;
      it was the unexpectedness of this queer situation, the shock of it...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I'll sit on the cot. It's a pig-sty here. But
      sometimes you can't help these things.... please tell me what dreadful
      thing has happened!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had large brown eyes... odd, with that hair!... and they met his, hung
      on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a low measured voice he explained:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The natives attacked a mission station here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, just a mission!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They burned it down, and killed all but one of the workers there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were they white?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The workers were Chinese, Christian Chinese. But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see! I couldn't imagine what it was all about. It's been frightful.
      Sitting here, without a word. But if it was just among the Chinese, then
      where's&mdash;I've got to tell you part of it&mdash;where's Harley
      Beggins? He brought me out here. He isn't the kind that skips out without
      a word. I've known him two years. He's a good fellow. You see, this thing&mdash;whatever
      it is&mdash;leaves me in a hole. I can't just sit here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am trying to tell you. Please listen as calmly as you can. First tell
      me something about this Harley Beggins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's with the Ho Shan Company. An engineer. But say&mdash;you don't mean&mdash;you're
      not going to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a young man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Tall. Curly hair. A fine-looking young man. And very refined. His
      family... but, my God, you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must keep quiet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep quiet! I'd like to know how, when you keep me in suspense like
      this!&rdquo; She was on her feet now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to tell you. But you must control yourself. Mr. Beggins must
      be the young engineer who tried to help the people in the compound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was killed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quiet! Yes, he was killed. I buried him this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the young woman's nerves gave way utterly, Doane found his mind
      divided between the cold thought of leaving her, perhaps asking the
      magistrate to give her an escort down to Ting Yang or up through the wall
      to Peking, and the other terribly strong impulse to stay. It was clear
      that she was not&mdash;well, a good woman; excitingly clear. She said odd
      things. &ldquo;Well, see where this mess leaves <i>me!</i>&rdquo; for one. And,
      &ldquo;What's to become of me? Do I just stay out here? Die here? Is this
      all?&rdquo;... When, daring a lull in the scene she was making he undertook to
      go, she clung to him and sobbed on his shoulder. The young engineer had
      meant little in her life. Her present emotion was almost wholly fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew, then, that he couldn't go. He was being swept toward destruction.
      It seemed like that. He could think coolly about it during the swift
      moments. He could watch his own case. One by one, in quick-flashing
      thoughts, he brought up all the arguments for morality, for duty, for
      common decency, and one by one they failed him. Something in life was too
      strong for him. Something in his nature.... This, then was the natural end
      of all his brooding, speculating, struggling with the demon of
      unbelief.... And even then he felt the hideously tragic quality of this
      hour.

      heart, he wished to be kind to her. Something of the long-frustrated
      emotional quality of the man overflowed toward her. He did what he could;
      laid her case before the magistrate, and left enough money to buy her a
      ticket to Peking from the northern railroad near Kalgan. This in the
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      One other thing he did in the morning was to write to Hidderleigh, at
      Shanghai, telling enough of the truth about his fall, and asking that his
      successor be sent out at the earliest moment possible. And he sent off the
      letter, early, at the Chinese post-office. At least he needn't play the
      hypocrite. The worst imaginable disaster had come upon him. His real life,
      it seemed, was over As for telling the truth at the mission, his mind
      would shape a course. The easiest thing would be to tell Boatwright,
      straight. Though in any case it would come around to them from Shanghai.
      He had sealed his fate when he posted the letter. They would surely know,
      all of them. Henry Withery would know. It would reach the congregations
      back there in the States. At the consulates and up and down the coast&mdash;where
      men drank and gambled and carved fortunes out of great inert China and
      loved as they liked&mdash;they would be laughing at him within a
      fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he thought of Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, on the march back to T'ainan, he stood, a solitary figure on
      the Pass of the Flighting Geese, looking up, arms outstretched, toward the
      mountain that for thousands of years has been to the sons of Han a sacred
      eminence; and the old prayer, handed down from another Oriental race as
      uttered by a greater sinner than he, burst from his lips:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will lift mine eyes to the hills, from whence cometh my help!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But no help came to Griggsby Duane that night. With tears lying warm on
      his cheeks he strode down the long slope toward Tainan.

      CHAPTER VII&mdash;LOVE IS A TROUBLE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T WAS early
      morning&mdash;the first day of April&mdash;when the Pacific liner that
      carried Betty Doane and Jonathan Brachey out of Yokohama dropped anchor in
      the river below Shanghai and there discharged passengers and freight for
      all central and northern China.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey, on that occasion, watched from his cabin porthole while Betty and
      the Hasmers descended the accommodation ladder and boarded the company's
      launch. Then, not before, he drank coffee and nibbled a roll. His long
      face was gray and deeply lined. He had not slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went up to Shanghai on the next launch, walked directly across the Bund
      to the row of steamship offices, and engaged passage on a north-bound
      coasting steamer. That evening he dined alone, out on the Yellow Sea,
      steaming toward Tsingtau, Chefu and (within the five days) Tientsin. He
      hadn't meant to take in the northern ports at this time; his planned
      itinerary covered the Yangtse Valley, where the disorderly young shoots of
      revolution were ripening slowly into red flower. But he was a shaken man.
      As he saw the problem of his romance, there were two persons to be saved,
      Betty and himself. He had behaved, on the one occasion, outrageously. He
      could see his action now as nothing other than weakness, curiously
      despicable, in the light of the pitiless facts. Reason had left him. Gusts
      of emotion lashed him. He now regarded the experience as a storm that must
      be somehow weathered. He couldn't weather it in Shanghai. Not with Betty
      there. He would surely seek her; find her. With his disordered soul he
      would cry out to her. In this alarming mood no subterfuge would appear too
      mean&mdash;sending clandestine notes by yellow hands, arranging furtive
      meetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was, of course, running away from her, from his task, from himself. It
      was expensive business. But he had meant to work up as far as Tientsin and
      Peking before the year ran out. He was, after all, but taking that part of
      it first. To this bit of justification he clung. He passed but one night
      at Tientsin, in the curiously British hotel, on an out-and-out British
      street, where one saw little more to suggest the East than the Chinese
      policeman at the corner, an occasional passing amah or mafoo, and the
      blue-robed, soft-footed hotel servants; then on to Peking by train, an
      easy four-hour run, lounging in a European dining-car where the allied
      troops had fought their way foot by foot only seven years earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey, though regarded by critical reviewers as a rising authority on
      the Far East, had never seen Peking. India he knew; the Straits
      Settlements&mdash;at Singapore and Penang he was a person of modest but
      real standing; Borneo, Java, Celebes and the rest of the vast archipelago,
      where flying fish skim a burnished sea and green islands float above a
      shimmering horizon against white clouds; the Philippines, Siam, Cochin
      China and Hongkong; but the swarming Middle Kingdom and its Tartar capital
      were fresh fuel to his coldly eager mind. He stopped, of course, at the
      almost Parisian hotel of the International Sleeping Car Company, just off
      Legation Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peking, in the spring of 1907, presented a far from unpleasant aspect to
      the eye of the traveler. The siege of the legations was already history
      and half-forgotten; the quarter itself had been wholly rebuilt. The
      clearing away of the crowded Chinese houses about the legations left <i>à
      glacis</i> of level ground that gave dignity to the walled enclosure.
      Legation Street, paved, bordered by stone walks and gray compound-walls,
      dotted with lounging figures of Chinese gatekeepers and alert sentries of
      this or that or another nation&mdash;British, American, Italian, Austrian,
      Japanese, French, Belgian, Dutch, German&mdash;offered a pleasant stroll
      of a late afternoon when the sun was low. Through gateways there were
      glimpses to be caught of open-air tea parties, of soldiers drilling, or
      even of children playing. Tourists wandered afoot or rolled by in
      rickshaws drawn by tattered blue and brown coolies.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the western end of the street beyond the American <i>glacis</i>, one
      might see the traffic through the Chien Gate, with now and then a nose-led
      train of camels humped above the throng; and beyond, the vast brick walls
      and the shining yellow palace roofs of the Imperial City. Around to the
      north, across the Japanese <i>glacis</i>, one could stroll, in the early
      evening, to the motion-picture show, where one-reel films from Paris were
      run off before an audience of many colors and more nations and costumes,
      while a placid Chinaman manipulated a mechanical piano.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>rachey had letters
      to various persons of importance along the street. With the etiquette of
      remote colonial capitals, he had long since trained himself to a
      mechanical conformity. Accordingly he devoted his first afternoon to a
      round of calls, by rickshaw; leaving cards in the box provided for the
      purpose at the gate house of each compound. Before another day had gone he
      found return cards in his box at the hotel; and thus was he established as
      <i>persona grata</i> on Legation Street. Invitations followed. The
      American minister had him for tiffin. There were pleasant meals at the
      legation barracks. Tourist groups at the hotel made the inevitable
      advances, which he met with austere dignity. Meantime he busied himself
      discussing with experts the vast problems confronting the Chinese in
      adjusting their racial life to the modern world, and within a few days was
      jotting down notes and preparing tentative outlines for his book.
    </p>
    <p>
      This activity brought him, at first, some relief from the emotional storm
      through which he had been passing. Work, he told himself, was the thing;
      work, and a deliberate avoidance of further entanglements.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, in taking this course, he was dealing severely with the girl whose
      brightly pretty face and gently charming ways had for a time disarmed him,
      he was dealing quite as severely with himself; for beneath his crust of
      self-sufficiency existed shy but turbulent springs of feeling. That was
      the trouble; that had always been the trouble; he dared not let himself
      feel, lie had let go once before, just once, only to skim the very border
      of tragedy. The color of that one bitter experience of his earlier manhood
      ran through every subsequent act of his life. Month by month, through the
      years, he had winced as he drew a check to the hard, handsome, strange
      woman who had been, it appeared, his wife; who was, incredibly, his wife
      yet. With a set face he had read and courteously answered letters from
      this stranger. A woman of worldly wants, all of which came, in the end, to
      money. The business of his life had settled down to a systematic meeting
      of those wants. That, and industriously employing his talent for travel
      and solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, the thing was to think, not feel. To logic and will he pinned his
      faith. Impulses rose every day, here in Peking, to write Betty. It
      wouldn't be hard to trace her father's address. For that matter he knew
      the city. He found it impossible to forget a word of hers. Vivid memories
      of her round pretty face, of the quick humorous expression about her brown
      eyes, the movements of her trim little head and slim body, recurred with,
      if anything, a growing vigor They would leap into his mind at unexpected,
      awkward moments, cutting the thread of sober conversations. At such
      moments he felt strongly that impulse to explain himself further. But his
      clear mind told him that there would be no good in it. None. She might
      respond; that would involve them the more deeply. He had gone too far. He
      had (this in the bitter hours) transgressed. The thing was to let her
      forget; it would, he sincerely tried to hope, be easier for her to forget
      than for himself He had to try to hope that.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>ut on an evening
      the American military attaché dined with him. They sat comfortably over
      the coffee and cigars at one side of the large hotel dining-room. Brachey
      liked the attaché. His military training, his strong practical instinct
      for fact, his absorption in his work, made him the sort with whom Brachey,
      who had no small talk, really no social grace, could let himself go. And
      the attaché knew China. He had traversed the interior from Manchuria and
      Mongolia to the borders of Thibet and the Loto country of Yunnan, and
      could talk, to sober ears, interestingly. On this occasion, after dwelling
      long on the activity of secret revolutionary societies in the southern
      provinces and in the Yangtse Valley, he suddenly threw out the following
      remark:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But of course, Brachey, there's an excellent chance, right now, to study
      a revolution in the making out here in Hansi. You can get into the heart
      of it in less than a week's travel. And if you don't mind a certain
      element of danger...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The very name of the province thrilled Brachey. He sat, fingering his
      cigar, his face a mask of casual attention, fighting to control the uprush
      of feeling. The attache was talking on. Brachey caught bits here and
      there; &ldquo;You've seen this crowd of banker persons from Europe around the
      hotel? Came out over the Trans Siberian with their families. A committee
      representing the Directorate of the Ho Shan Company. The story is that
      they've been asked to keep out of Hansi for the present for fear of
      violence.... You'd get the whole thing, out there&mdash;officials with a
      stake 'n the local mines shrewdly stirring up trouble while pretending to
      put it down; rich young students agitating, the Chinese equivalent of our
      soap-box Socialists; and queer Oriental motives and twists that you and I
      can't expect to understand.... The significant thing though, the big fact
      for you, I should say&mdash;is that if the Hansi agitators succeed in
      turning this little rumpus over the mining company into something of a
      revolution against the Imperial Government, it'll bring them into an
      understanding with the southern provinces. It may yet prove the deciding
      factor in the big row. Something as if Ohio should go democratic this
      year, back home. You see?... There are queer complications. Our Chinese
      secretary says that a personal quarrel between two mandarins is a
      prominent item in the mix-up.... That's the place for you, all right&mdash;Hansi!
      They've got the narrow-gauge railway nearly through to T'ainan-fu, I
      believe. You can pick up a guide here at the hotel. He'll engage a cook.
      You won't drink the water, of course; better carry a few cases of Tan San.
      And don't eat the green vegetables. Take some beef and mutton and potatoes
      and rice. You can buy chickens and eggs. Get a money belt and carry all
      the Mexican dollars you can stagger under. Provincial money's no good a
      hundred miles away. Take some English gold for a reserve. That's good
      everywhere. And you'll want your overcoat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes later Brachey heard this:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A. P. Browning, the Agent General of the Ho Shan Company, is stopping
      here now, along with the committee. Talk with him, first. Get the
      company's view of it. He'll talk freely. Then go out there and have a look&mdash;see
      for yourself. Say the word, and I'll give you a card to Browning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Brachey looked up. It seemed to him, so momentous was the hour, that
      his pulse had stopped. He sat very still, looking at his guest, obviously
      about to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attaché, to whom this man's deliberate cold manner was becoming a
      friendly enough matter of course, waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Brachey finally said. &ldquo;Be glad to have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the particular card, scribbled by the attaché, there across the table,
      was never presented. For late that night, in a bitter revulsion of
      feeling, Brachey tore it up.
    </p>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n the morning,
      however, when he stopped at the desk, the Belgian clerk handed him a thick
      letter from his attorney in New York, forwarded from his bank in Shanghai.
      He read and reread it, while his breakfast turned cold; studied it with an
      unresponsive brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed that his wife's attorney had approached his with a fresh
      proposal. Her plan had been to divorce him on grounds of desertion and
      non-support; this after his refusal to supply what is euphemistically
      termed &ldquo;statutory evidence.&rdquo; But the fact that she had from month to month
      through the years accepted money from him, and not infrequently had
      demanded extra sums by letter and telegram, made it necessary that he
      enter into collusion with her to the extent of keeping silent and
      permitting her suit to go through unopposed. His own instructions to his
      lawyer stood flatly to the contrary.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a new element had entered the situation. She wished to marry again.
      The man of her new choice had means enough to care for her comfortably.
      And in her eagerness to be free she proposed to release him from payment
      of alimony beyond an adjustment to cover the bare cost of her suit, on
      condition that he withdraw his opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the old maneuvering and bargaining. At first thought it disgusted
      and hurt him. The woman's life had never come into contact with his, since
      the first few days of their married life, without hurting him. He had been
      harsh, bitter, unforgiving. He had believed himself throughout in the
      right. She had shown (in his view) no willingness to take marriage
      seriously, give him and herself a fair trial, make a job of it. She had
      exhibited no trait that he could accept as character. It had seemed to him
      just that she should suffer as well as he.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, as the meaning of the letter penetrated his mind, his spirits
      began to rise. It was a tendency he resisted; but he was helpless. From
      moment to moment his heart, swelled. Not once before in four years had the
      thought of freedom occurred to him as a desirable possibility. But now he
      knew that he would accept it, even at the cost of collusion and
      subterfuge. He saw nothing of the humor in the situation; that he, who had
      judged the woman so harshly, should find his code of ethics, his very
      philosophy, dashed to the ground by a look from a pair of brown eyes,
      meant little. It was simply that up to the present time an ethical
      attitude had been the important thing, whereas now the important thing was
      Betty. That was all there seemed to be to it. But then there had been
      almost as little of humor as of love in the queerly solitary life of
      Jonathan Brachey.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cabled his attorney, directly after breakfast, to agree to the divorce.
      Before noon he had engaged a guide and arranged with him to take the
      morning train southward to the junction whence that narrow-gauge Hansi
      Line was pushing westward toward the ancient provincial capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all this there was no plan. Brachey, confused, aware that the
      instinctive pressures of life were too much for him, that he was beaten,
      was soberly, breathlessly, driving toward the girl who had touched and
      tortured his encrusted heart. He was not even honest with himself; he
      couldn't be. He dwelt on the importance of studying the Hansi problem at
      close range He decided, among other things, that he wouldn't permit
      himself to see Betty, that he would merely stay secretly near her,
      certainly until a cablegram from New York should announce his positive
      freedom. In accordance with this decision he tore up his letters to her as
      fast as they were written. If the fact that he was now writing such
      letters indicated an alarming condition in his emotional nature, at least
      his will was still intact. He proved that by tearing them up. He even
      found this thought encouraging.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, of course, he had taken his real beating when he gave up his plans
      and caught the coasting steamer at Shanghai. He was to learn now that
      rushing away from Betty and rushing toward her were irradiations of the
      same emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left Peking on that early morning way-train of passenger and freight
      cars, without calling again at the legation; merely sent a chit to the
      Commandant of Marines to say that he was off. He had not heard of the
      requirement that a white traveler into the interior carry a consular
      passport countersigned by Chinese authorities, and also, for purposes of
      identification, a supply of cards with the Chinese equivalent of his name;
      so he set forth without either, and (as a matter of fixed principle)
      without firearms.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>ASSENGER traffic
      on the Hansi Line ended at this time at a village called Shau T'ing, in
      the heart of the red mountains. Brachey spent the night in a native
      caravansary, his folding cot set up on the earthen floor. The room was
      dirty, dilapidated, alive with insects and thick with ancient odors. A
      charcoal fire in the crumbling brick <i>kang</i> gave forth fumes of gas
      that suggested the possibility of asphyxiation before morning. Brachey
      sent his guide, a fifty-year-old Tientsin Chinese of corpulent figure,
      known, for convenience, as &ldquo;John,&rdquo; for water and extinguished the fire.
      The upper half of the inner wall was a wooden lattice covered with paper;
      and by breaking all the paper squares within his reach, Brachey contrived
      to secure a circulation of air. Next he sent John for a piece of new
      yellow matting, and by spreading this under the cot created a mild
      sensation of cleanliness, which, though it belied the facts, made the
      situation a thought more bearable. For Brachey, though a veteran traveler,
      was an extremely fastidious man. He bore dirt and squalor, had borne them
      at intervals for years, without ever losing his squeamish discomfort at
      the mere thought of them. But the stern will that was during these, years
      the man's outstanding trait, and his intense absorption in his work, had
      kept him driving ahead through all petty difficulties. The only outward
      sign of the strain it put him to was an increased irritability.
    </p>
    <p>
      He traveled from Shau T'ing to Ping Yang, the next day in an unroofed
      freight ear without a seat, crowded in with thirty-odd Chinese and their
      luggage. During the entire day he spoke hardly a word. His two servants
      guarded him from contact with the other natives; but he ignored even his
      own men. At a way station, where the engine waited half an hour for water
      and coal, a lonely division engineer from Lombardy called out a greeting
      in bad French. Brachey coldly snubbed the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He planned to pick up either a riding animal or a mule litter at Ping
      Yang. As it turned out, the best John could secure was a freight cart;
      springless, of course. T'ainan was less than a hundred miles away, yet he
      was doomed to three days of travel in a creaking, hard-riding cart through
      the sunken roads, where dust as fine as flour sifts through the clothing
      and rubs into the pores of the skin, and to two more nights at native inns&mdash;with
      little hope of better accommodation at T'ainan.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Brachey was in a state of nerves that alarmed even himself.
      Neither will nor imagination was proving equal to this new sort of strain.
      The confusion of motives that had driven him out here provided no sound
      justification for the journey. When he tried to think work now, he found
      himself thinking Betty. And misgivings were creeping into his mind. It
      amounted to demoralization.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked out after the solitary dinner of soup and curried chicken and
      English strawberry jam. The little village was settling into evening calm.
      Men and boys, old women and very little girls, sat in the shop fronts&mdash;here
      merely rickety porticoes with open doorways giving on dingy courtyards&mdash;or
      played about the street. Carpenters were still working on the roof of the
      new railway station. Three young men, in an open field, were playing
      decorously with a shuttlecock of snake's skin and duck feathers, deftly
      kicking it from player to player. Farther along the street a middle-aged
      man of great dignity, clad in a silken robe and black skull-cap with the
      inevitable red knot, was flying a colored kite ... through all this,
      Jonathan Brachey, the expert observer, wandered about unseeing.

      hill, however, rounding a turn in the road, he stopped short, suddenly
      alive to the vivid outer world. A newly built wall of brick stood before
      him, enclosing an area of two acres or more, within which appeared the
      upper stories of European houses, as well as the familiar curving roofs of
      Chinese tile. And just outside the walls two young men and two young
      women, in outing clothes, white folk all, were playing tennis. To their
      courteous greeting he responded frigidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later a somewhat baffled young Australian led him to the office of M.
      Pourmont and presented him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distinguished French engineer, looking up from his desk, beheld a tall
      man in homespun knickerbockers, a man with a strong if slightly forbidding
      face. He fingered the card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Monsieur Brashayee! Indeed, yes! It is ze <i>grand plaisir!</i> But
      it mus' not be true zat you go on all ze vay to T'ainan-fu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Brachey replied with icy courtesy, &ldquo;I am going to T'ainan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But ze time, he is not vat you call&mdash;-ripe. One makes ze trouble. It
      is only a month zat zay t'row ze <i>pierre</i> at me, zay tear ze cart of
      me, zay destroy ze ear of me! <i>Choses affreuses!</i> I mus'not let you
      go!''
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey heard this without taking it in any degree to himself. He was
      looking at the left ear of this stout, bearded Parisian, from which, he
      observed, the lobe was gone.... Then, with a quickening pulse, he thought
      of Betty out there in T'ainan, in real danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come wiz me!&rdquo; cried M. Pourmont. &ldquo;I vill show you vat ve do&mdash;<i>nous
      ici</i>.&rdquo; And snatching up a bunch of keys he led Brachey out about the
      compound. He opened one door upon what appeared to be a heap of old
      clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Des sac â terres</i>,&rdquo; he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey picked one up. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he remarked, coldly interested&mdash;&ldquo;sand-bags!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is zat. Sand-bag for ze vail. Ve have ze <i>femme Chinoise</i>&mdash;ze
      Chinese vimmen&mdash;sew zem all every day. And you vill look...&rdquo; He led
      the way with this to a corner of the grounds where the firm loess had been
      turned up with a pick. &ldquo;It is so, Monsieur Brashayee, <i>partout</i>. All
      is ready. In von night ve fill ze bag, ve are a fort, ve are ready....
      See! An' see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed out a low scaffolding built here and there along the compound
      wall for possible use as a firing step. Just outside the wall crowding
      native houses were being torn down. &ldquo;I buy zem,&rdquo; explained M. Pourmont
      with a chuckle, &ldquo;an' I clear avay. I make a <i>glacis, nest ce pas?</i>&rdquo;
       On several of the flat roofs of supply sheds along the wall were heaps of
      the bags, ready filled, covered from outside eyes with old boards. In one
      building, under lock and key, were two machine guns and box on box of
      ammunition. Back in M. Pourmont's private study was a stand of modern
      rifles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You vill see by all zis vat is ze t'ought of myself,&rdquo; concluded the
      genial Frenchman. &ldquo;Ze trouble he is real. It is not safe to-day in Hansi.
      Ze Société of ze Great Eye&mdash;ze Lookair&mdash;he grow, he <i>fait
      l'exercice</i>, he make ze t'reat. You vill not go to T'ainan, alone. It
      is not right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey was growing impatient now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he said, more shortly than he knew. &ldquo;I will go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have ze arm&mdash;ze revolvair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You vill, zen, allow me to give you zis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Brachey declined the weapon stiffly, said good night, and returned to
      the inn below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning a Chinese servant brought a note from M Pourmont. If he
      would go&mdash;thus that gentleman&mdash;and if he would not so much as
      carry arms for protection, at least he must be sure to get into touch with
      M. Griggsby Duane at once on arriving at T'ianan. M. Doane was a man of
      strength and address. He would be the only support that M. Brachey could
      look for in that turbulent corner of the world.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he lamp threw a
      flickering unearthly light, faintly yellow, on the tattered wall-hangings
      that bore the Chinese characters signifying happiness and hospitality and
      other genial virtues. The lamp was of early Biblical pattern, nor unlike a
      gravy boat of iron, full of oil or grease, in which the wick floated. It
      stood on the roughly-made table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inn compound was still, save for the stirring and the steady crunching
      of the horses and mules at their long manger across the courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey, half undressed, sat on his cot, staring at the shadowy brick
      wall. His face was haggard. There were hollows under the eyes. His hands
      lay, listless, on his knees. The fire that had been for a fortnight
      consuming him was now, for the moment, burnt out.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at least, he now felt, the particular storm was over. That there might
      be recurrences, he recognized. That girl had found her way, through all
      the crust, to his heart. The result had been nearly unbearable while it
      lasted. It had upset his reason; made a fool of him. Here he was&mdash;now&mdash;less
      than a day's journey from her. He couldn't go back; the thought stirred
      savagely what he thought of as the shreds of his self-respect. And yet to
      go on was, or seemed, unthinkable. The best solution seemed to be merely
      to make use of T'ainan as a stopping place for the night and pass on to
      some other inland city. But this thought carried with it the unnerving
      fear that he would fail to pass on, that he might even communicate with
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      His life, apparently, was a lie. He had believed since his boyhood that
      human companionship lay apart from the line of his development. Even his
      one or two boy friends he had driven off. The fact embittered his earlier
      life; but it was so. In each instance he had said harsh things that the
      other could not or would not overlook. His marriage had contributed
      further proof. Along with his pitilessly detached judgment of the woman
      went the sharp consciousness that he, too, had failed at it. He couldn't
      adapt his life to the lives of others. Since that experience&mdash;these
      four years&mdash;by living alone, keeping away, keeping clear out of his
      own land, even out of touch with the white race, and making something of a
      success of it, he had not only proved himself finally, he had even, in a
      measure, justified himself. Yet now, a chance meeting with a
      nineteen-year-old girl had, at a breath, destroyed the laborious structure
      of his life. It all came down to the fact that emotion had at last caught
      him as surely as it had caught the millions of other men&mdash;men he had
      despised. He couldn't live now without feeling again that magic touch of
      warmth in his breast. He couldn't go on alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed his head over it. Round and round went his thoughts, cutting
      deeper and deeper into the tempered metal of his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said to her: &ldquo;I am selfish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had supposed he was telling the simple truth. But clearly he wasn't. At
      this moment, as at every moment since that last night on the boat deck, he
      was as dependent on her as a helpless child. And now he wasn't even
      selfish. These two days since the little talk with M. Pourmont he had been
      stirred deeply by the thought that she was in danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over and over, with his almost repelling detachment of mind, he reviewed
      the situation. She might not share his present emotion. Perhaps she had
      recovered quickly from the romantic drift that had caught them on the
      ship. She was a sensitive, expressive little thing; quite possibly the new
      environment had caught her up and changed her, filled her life with fresh
      interest or turned it in a new direction. With this thought was interwoven
      the old bitter belief that no woman could love him. It must have been that
      she was stirred merely by that romantic drift and had endowed him, the
      available man, with the charms that dwelt only in her own fancy. Young
      girls were impressionable; they did that.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suppose&mdash;it was excitingly implausible&mdash;she hadn't swung
      away from him. What would her missionary folk say to him and his
      predicament? Sooner or later he would be free; but would that clear him
      with these dogmatic persons, with her father? Probably not. And if not,
      wouldn't the fact thrust unhappiness upon her? You could trust these
      professionally religious people, he believed, to make her as unhappy as
      they could&mdash;nag at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose, finally, the unthinkable thing, that she&mdash;he could hardly
      formulate even the thought; he couldn't have uttered it&mdash;loved him.
      What did he know of her? Who was she? What did she know of adult life?
      What were her little day-by-day tastes and impulses, such as make or break
      any human companionship...? And who was he? What right had he to take on
      his shoulders the responsibility for a human life... a delicately joyous
      little life? For that was what it came down to. It came to him, now, like
      a ray of blipdirig light, that he who quickens the soul of a girl must
      carry the burden of that soul to his grave. At times during the night he
      thought wistfully of his freedom, of his pleasant, selfish solitude and
      the inexigent companionship of his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      His suit-case lay on the one chair. He drew it over; got out the huge,
      linen-mounted map of the Chinese Empire that is published by the China
      Inland Mission, and studied the roads about T'ainan. That from the east&mdash;his
      present route&mdash;swung to the south on emerging from the hills, and
      approached the city nearly from that direction. Here, instead of turning
      up into the city, he could easily enough strike south on the valley road,
      perhaps reaching an apparently sizable village called Hung Chan by night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He decided to do that, and afterward to push southwest. It should be
      possible to find a way out along the rivers tributary to the Yangtse,
      reaching that mighty stream at either Ichang or Hankow. And he would work
      diligently, budding up again the life that had been so quickly and lightly
      overset. At least, for the time. He must try himself out This riding his
      emotions wouldn't do. At some stage of the complicated experience it was
      going to be necessary to stop and think. Of course, if he should find
      after a reasonable time, say a few months, that the emotion persisted, why
      then, with his personal freedom established, he might write Betty, simply
      stating his case.
    </p>
    <p>
      And after all this, on the following afternoon, dusty, tired of body and
      soul, Jonathan Brachey rode straight up to the East Gate of T'ainan-fu.

      CHAPTER IX&mdash;KNOTTED LIVES

    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>F Brachey had
      approached that East Gate a year later he would have rolled comfortably
      into the city in a rickshaw (which has followed the white man into China)
      along a macadamized road bordered by curbing of concrete from the new
      railway station. But in the spring of 1907 there was no station, no
      pavement, not a rickshaw. The road was a deep-rutted way, dusty in dry
      weather, muddy in wet, bordered by the crumbling shops and dwellings found
      on the outskirts of every Chinese city. A high, bumpy little bridge of
      stone spanned the moat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over this bridge rode Brachey, in his humble cart, sitting fiat under a
      span of tattered matting, surrounded and backed by his boxes and bales of
      food and water and his personal baggage. John and the cook rode behind on
      mules. The muleteers walked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the gate were lounging soldiers, coolies, beggars, and a
      money-changer or two with their bags of silver lumps, their strings of
      copper cash and their balanced scales. Two of the soldiers sprang forward
      and stopped the cart. Despite their ragged uniforms (of a dingy blue, of
      course, like all China, and capped with blue turbans) these were tall,
      alert men. Brachey was rapidly coming to recognize the Northern Chinese as
      a larger, browner, more vigorous type of being than the soft little yellow
      men of the South with whom he had long been familiar in the United States
      as well as in the East. A mure dangerous man, really, this northerner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey leaned back on his baggage and watched the little encounter
      between his John and the two soldiers. Any such conversation in China is
      likely to take up a good deal of time, with many gestures, much vehemence
      of speech and an 'ncreasing volume of interference from the inevitable
      curious crowd. The cook and the two muleteers joined the argument, Brachey
      had learned before the first evening that this interpreter of his had no
      English beyond the few pidgin phrases common to all speech along the
      coast. And since leaving Shau T'ing it had transpired that the man's
      Tientsin-Peking dialect sounded strange in the ears of Hansi John was now
      in the position of an interpreter who could make headway in neither of the
      languages in which he was supposed to deal. Brachey didn't mind. It kept
      the man still. And he had learned years earlier that the small affairs of
      routine traveling can be managed with but few spoken words. But just now,
      idly watching the little scene, he would have liked to know what it meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally John came to the cart, followed by shouts from the soldiers and
      the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Card wanchee,&rdquo; he managed to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Card? No savvy,&rdquo; said Brachey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Card,&rdquo; John nodded earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey produced his personal card, bearing his name in English and the
      address of a New York club.
    </p>
    <p>
      John studied it anxiously, and then passed it to one of the soldiers. That
      official fingered it; turned it over; discussed it with his fellow.
      Another discussion followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey now lost interest. He filled and lighted his pipe; then drew from
      a pocket a small leather-bound copy of <i>The Bible in Spain</i>, opened
      at a bookmark, and began reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a wanderer after his own heart&mdash;George Borrow! An eager
      adventurer, at home in any city of any clime, at ease in any company, a
      fellow with gipsies, bandits, Arabs, Jews of Gibraltar and Greeks of
      Madrid, known from Mogadore to Moscow. Bor-row's missionary employment
      puzzled him as a curious inconsistency; his skill at making much of every
      human contact was, to the misanthropic Brachey, enviable; his genius for
      solitude, his self-sufficiency in every state, whether confined in prison
      at Madrid or traversing alone the dangerous wilderness of Galicia, were to
      Brachey points of fine fellowship. This man needed no wife, no friend. His
      enthusiasm for the new type of human creature or the unfamiliar tongue
      never weakened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cart jolted, creaking, forward, into the low tunnel that served as a
      gateway through the massive wall. A soldier walked on either hand. Two
      other soldiers walked in the rear. The crowd, increasing every moment,
      trailed off behind. Small boys jeered, even threw bits of dirt and stones,
      one of which struck a soldier and caused a brief diversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      They creaked on through the narrow, crowded streets of the city. A murmur
      ran ahead from shop to shop and corner to corner. Porters, swaying under
      bending bamboo, shuffled along at a surprising pace and crowded past.
      Merchants stood in doorways and puffed at lung pipes with tiny nickel
      bowls as the strange parade went by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally it stopped. Two great studded gates swung inward, and the cart
      lurched into the courtyard of an inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey appropriated a room, sent John for hot water, and coolly shaved.
      Then he stretched out on the folding cot above its square of matting,
      refilled his pipe and resumed his Borrow.
    </p>
    <h3>

    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ithin half an hour
      fresh soldiers appeared, armed with carbines and revolvers, and settled
      themselves comfortably, two of them, by his door; two others taking up a
      position at the compound gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      They brought a letter, in Chinese characters, on red paper in a buff and
      red envelope, which Brachey examined with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No savvy,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the faithful John, inarticulate from confusion and fright could not
      translate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between this hour in mid-afternoon and early evening, six of these
      documents were passed in through Brachey's door. With the last one, John
      appeared to see a little light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Number one policeman wanchee know pidgin belong you,&rdquo; he explained
      laboriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      That would doubtless mean the police minister. So they wanted to know his
      business! But as matters stood, with no other medium of communication than
      John's patient but bewildered brain, explanation would be difficult.
      Brachey reached for his book and read on. Something would have to happen,
      of course. It really hardly mattered what. He even felt a little relief.
      The authorities might settle his business for him. Pack him off. It would
      be better. M. Pourmont's letter to Griggsby Doane had burned in his pocket
      for two days. It had seemed to press him, like the hand of fate, to
      Betty's very roof. Now, since he had become&mdash;the simile rose&mdash;a
      passive shuttlecock, a counterplay of fate might prove a way out of his
      dilemma.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had chicken fried in oil for his dinner. And John ransacked the boxes
      for dainties; as if the occasion demanded indulgence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight John knocked with shaking hands at his door. It was dark in the
      courtyard, and a soft April rain was falling. Two fresh soldiers stood
      there, each with carbine on back and a lighted paper lantern in band. A
      boy from the inn held two closed umbrellas of oiled paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go now,&rdquo; said John, out of a dry throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go what side?&rdquo; asked Brachey, surveying the little group.
    </p>
    <p>
      John could not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey compressed his lips; stood there, knocking his pipe against the
      door-post. Then, finally, he put on overcoat and rubber overshoes, took
      one of the umbrellas, and set forth.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hey walked a long
      way through twisting, shadowy streets, first a soldier with the boy from
      the inn, then Brachey under his umbrella, then John under another, then
      the second soldier. Dim figures finished past them. Once the quaint waihng
      of stringed instruments floated out over a compound wall. They passed
      through a dark tunnel that must have been one of the city gates; then on
      through other streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stopped at a gate house. A door opened, and yellow lamplight fell
      warmly across the way. Brachey found himself stepping up into a structure
      that was and yet was not Chinese. A smiling old gate-keeper received him
      with striking courtesy, and, to his surprise, in English.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come with me, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John and the soldiers waited in the gate house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey followed the old man across a paved court. His pulse quickened.
      Where were they bringing him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Through a window he saw a white woman sitting at a desk, under an American
      lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      He mounted stone steps, left his coat and hat in a homelike front hall.
      The servant led the way up a flight of carpeted stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the top step, Brachey paused. At the end of the corridor, where a chair
      or two, a table, bookcase, and lamp made a pleasant little lounge, a young
      woman sat quietly reading. She looked up; sat very still, gazing straight
      at him out of a white face. It was Betty. His heart seemed to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a man stood before him. A little, dusty blond man. They were clasping
      hands. He was ushered rather abruptly into a study. The door closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man said something twice. It proved to be, &ldquo;I am Mr.
      Boatwright,&rdquo; and he was looking down at the much-thumbed card; Brachey's
      own card.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey was fighting to gather his wits. Why hadn't he spoken to Betty, or
      she to him? Would she wait there to see him? If not, how could he reach
      her?... He must reach her, of course. He knew now that through all his
      confusion of mind and spirit he had come straight to her.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he little man was
      nervous, Brachey observed; even jumpy. He hurried about, drawing down the
      window-shades. Then he sat at a desk and with twitching fingers rolled a
      pencil about. He cleared his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've come in from the railroad?&rdquo; he asked.... &ldquo;Yes? Do you bring news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Brachey coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What gossip have your boys picked up along the road, may I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Back and forth, back and forth, his fingers twitched the pencil. Bradley's
      eyes narrowly followed the movement. After a little, he replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no information from my boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven years ago&rdquo;&mdash;thus Mr. Boatwright, huskily, &ldquo;they killed all but
      a few of us. Now the trouble has started again&mdash;a similar trouble
      They attacked our station up at So T'ung yesterday. Mr. Doane is on his
      way there now. He left this noon. That is why they referred your case to
      me. Oh. yes, I should have told you&mdash;the tao-tai, Chang Chili Ting,
      has asked me to get from you an explanation of your appearance here
      without a passport. But perhaps your card explains. You come simply as a
      journalist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no connection w ith the Ho Shan Company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chang is taking up your case this evening with the provincial judge, Pao
      Ting Chuan. Pao is to give you an audience to-morrow, I believe, at noon.
      I will act as your interpreter.&rdquo; Mr. Boatwright paused, and sighed. &ldquo;I am
      very busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret this intrusion on your time,&rdquo; said Brachey. It was impossible
      for him to be more than barely courteous to such a man as this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's all right,&rdquo; Boatwright replied vaguely. &ldquo;The audience will
      probably be at noon. Then you will come back here with me for tiffin.&rdquo; He
      sighed again; then went on. &ldquo;They shot one of Pourmont's white men.
      Through the lungs.... You must have seen Pourmont at Ping Yang, as you
      came through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I called on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't he tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He advised against my coming on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. It's really very difficult. He wants us all to get out, as far
      as his compound. But, you see, our predicament is delicate. Already
      they've attacked one of our outposts. But the trouble may not spread. We
      can't draw in our people and leave at the first sign of difficulty. It
      would be interpreted as weakness not only on our part but on the part of
      all the white governments as well. Mr. Doane, I know&rdquo;&mdash;he said this
      rather regretfully&mdash;&ldquo;would never consent to that.... Mr. Doane is a
      strong man. We shall all breathe a little more easily when he is safely
      back. If he should not get back&mdash;well, you will see that I must face
      this situation&mdash;-the decision would fall on me. That's why I asked
      you for news. I have to consider the problem from every angle. We have
      other stations about the province and we must plan to draw all our people
      in before we can even consider a general retreat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey heard part of this. He wished the man would keep still: His own
      racing thoughts were with that pale girl in the hall. Was she still there?
      He must plan. He must be prepared with something to say, if they should
      meet face to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it turned out, they met on the stairs. Betty was coming up. She paused;
      looked up, then down. The color stole back into her face; flooded it. She
      raised her hand, hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      Brachey heard and felt the surprise of Boatwright, behind him. The little
      man said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey felt the warm little hand in his. It should have been, easy to
      explain their acquaintance; to speak of the ship, ask after the Hasmers.
      In the event, however, it proved impossible, all he could say&mdash;he
      heard the dry hard tones issuing from his own lips:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how do you do! How have you been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty said, after too long a pause, glancing up momentarily at Mr.
      Boatwright:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Brachey was on the steamer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was odd, that little situation. It might so easily have escaped being a
      situation, had not their own turbulent hearts made it so. But now, of
      course, neither could explain why they hadn't spoke before he went into
      the study. And little, distrait Mr. Boatwright was wide-eyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation passed from mildly bad to a little worse. Betty went on up
      the stairs; and Brachey went down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The casual parting came upon Brachey like a tragedy. It was unthinkable.
      Something personal he must say. On the morrow it might be worse, with a
      whole household crowding about. It was a question if he could face her at
      all, that way. He got to the bottom step; then, with an apparently
      offhand, &ldquo;I beg your pardon!&rdquo; brushed past the now openly astonished
      Boatwright and bolted back up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty moved a little way along the upper hall; hesitated; glanced back.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke, low, in her ear. &ldquo;I must see you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her head inclined a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once! I must see you once. I can't leave it this way. Then I will go.
      To-morrow&mdash;at tiffin&mdash;if we can't talk together&mdash;you must
      give me some word. A note, perhaps, telling me how I can see you alone.
      There is one thing I must tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please!&rdquo; she murmured. There were tears in her eyes. They scalded his own
      high-beating heart, those tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will plan it? I am helpless. But I must see you&mdash;tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thought her head inclined again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will? You'll give me a note? Oh, promise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she whispered; and slipped away into another room.
    </p>
    <p>
      So this is why he had to come to T'ainan-fu&mdash;to tell her the
      tremendous news that he would one day be free! And she had promised to
      arrange a meeting!
    </p>
    <p>
      Never in all his cold life had Jonathan Brachey experienced such a thrill
      as followed that soft &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not a word passed between him and Boatwright until they stood in the gate
      house. Then, for an instant, their eyes met. He had to fight back the
      burning triumph that was in his own. But the little man seemed glad to
      look away; he was even evasive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better be around about half past eleven in the morning,&rdquo; said he.
      &ldquo;We'll go to the yamen from here. We must have blue carts and the extra
      servants. Good night.&rdquo; And again he sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was all. Boatwright let him go like that, back to the dirty,
      dangerous native inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell in behind the leading soldier, holding his umbrella high and
      marching stiffly, like a conqueror, through the sucking mud.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>ETTY did not get
      down for breakfast in the morning. And Mrs. Boatwright sent nothing up.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was close upon noon when Betty, sketching portfolio under arm, came
      slowly down the stairs. Mrs. Boatwright, at her desk in the front room,
      glanced up, called:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Betty&mdash;just a moment!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl stood in the doorway. She looked so slim and small and, even,
      childlike, that the older woman, to whom responsibility for all things and
      persons about her was a habit, knit her heavy brows slightly. What on
      earth were you to do with the child? What had Griggsby Doane been thinking
      of in bringing her out here? Anything, almost, would have been better. And
      just now, of all times!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you mind coming in? There's a question or two I'd like to ask you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty paused by a rocking chair of black walnut that was upholstered in
      crimson plush; fingered the crimson fringe. Mrs. Boatwright was marking
      out a geometrical pattern on the back of an envelope; frowning down at it.
      The silence grew heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally Mrs. Boatwright, never light of hand, rame out with:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This Mr. Brachey&mdash;who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty's fringed lids moved swiftly up; dropped again. &ldquo;He&mdash;he's a
      writer, a journalist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew him on the ship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew him pretty well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;saw something of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know why he came out here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think you would ask him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boatwright considered this. The girl was selfconscious, a little. And
      quietly&mdash;very quietly&mdash;hostile. Or perhaps merely on the
      defensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you do know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Betty, with that same very quiet gravity, &ldquo;I can't say that
      I do. He is studying China, of course. He came from America to do that, I
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know he was coming out here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty slowly shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been corresponding with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another silence. Then this from Betty, without heat:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand why you are asking these questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you unwilling to answer them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such personal questions as that last one&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no right to ask it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Mrs. Boatwright considered. &ldquo;Hmm!&rdquo; She controlled her temper and
      framed her next remark with care. This slip of a girl was unexpectedly in
      fiber like Griggsby Doane. There was no weakness in her quiet resistance,
      no yielding. Perhaps she was strong, after all. Though she looked soft
      enough; gentle like her mother. Perhaps, even, she was a person, of
      herself. This was a new thought. Mrs. Boatwright drew a parallelogram,
      then painstakingly shaded the lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We mustn't misunderstand each other, Betty,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;In your father's
      absence, I am responsible for you. This man has appeared rather
      mysteriously. His business is not clear. The tao-tai asked Mr. Boatwright
      to look him up, for it seems he hasn't even an interpreter. He has just
      been here. They've gone for an audience with the provincial judge. Mr.
      Boatwright has asked him to come back here for tiffin. Which was rather
      impulsive, I'm afraid....&rdquo; She paused; started outlining an octagon. &ldquo;I
      may as well come out with it. Mr. Boatwright told me a little of what
      happened last evening&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what happened But nothing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please! Mr. Boatwright is not a particularly observant man in
      these matters, but he couldn't help seeing that there is something between
      you and this Mr. Brachey.... Now, since you see what is in my mind, will
      you tell me why he is here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this speech Betty stopped fingering the crimson fringe. She stood
      motionless, holding the portfolio still against her side. A slow color
      crept into her cheeks. She wouldn't, or couldn't, speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, if you won't answer that question, will you at least tell me
      something of what you do know about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know very little about him,&rdquo; said Betty now, in a low but clear voice,
      without emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must try to make you understand this, my dear. Here the man is. Within
      the hour we are to sit down at tiffin with him. It is growing clearer
      every minute that Mr. Boatwright's suspicion was correct&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no right to use that word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, his surmise, say. There <i>is</i> something between you and
      this man. Don't you think you'd better tell me what it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing&mdash;nothing at all&mdash;that I need tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there nothing that you ought to tell your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can not speak for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stand in his place, while he's away It is a responsibility I must
      accept. You say you know very little about the man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You met him on the ship, by chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know any of his friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything of his past?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty hesitated. Then, as the woman glanced keenly up, she replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only what he has told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, even, whether he is a married man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another long silence fell. Betty stood as quietly as before, looking out
      of frank brown eyes at the sunlit courtyard and the gate house beyond
      where old Sun Shao-i, seated on a stool, was having the inside of his
      eyelids scraped by an itinerant barber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Betty replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that he <i>is</i> married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>etty, as she threw
      out this bit of uncompromising truth, was stirred with a thrill of wilder
      adventure than had hitherto entered her somewhat untrammeled young life.
      The situation had outrun her experience; she was acting on instinct. There
      was a sense of shock, too; and of hurt&mdash;hurt that Mrs. Boatwright
      could look, feel, so forbidding. Her firm face, now pressed together from
      chin to forehead, wrinkled across, squinting unutterable suspicions,
      stirred a resistance in Betty's breast that for a little time flared into
      anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no telling what Mrs. Boatwright felt. Her frown even relaxed,
      after a moment. The outbreak of moral superiority that Betty looked for
      didn't come. Instead she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you learn this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he wrote a letter before he&mdash;went away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh. he went away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He went. Without a word. I didn't know where he was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When was that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we landed at Shanghai.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly three weeks ago. He's here now. Tell me&mdash;he wouldn't have
      gone off like that, of course, leaving such an intimate letter, unless a
      pretty definite situation had arisen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you tell me what it was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;I really have a right to ask this of you&mdash;will you give
      me your word not to see him until your father returns, and then not until
      you have laid it before him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence again. The fringed lids fluttered. A small hand reached for the
      crimson fringe, slim fingers clung there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty's thoughts were running away. She felt the situation now as a form
      of torture. That grim experienced woman must be partly right, of course;
      Betty was still so young as to defer mechanically to her elders, and she
      had no great opinion of herself, of her strength of character or her
      judgment. She thought of the boys at home, who had been fond of her. ...
      She thought of Harold Apgar, over there in Korea. He was clean, likable,
      prosperous; and he wanted to marry her. It really would solve her
      problems, could she only feel toward him so much as a faint reflection of
      the glow that Jonathan Brachey had aroused in her. But nothing in her
      nature answered Harold Apgar. For that matter&mdash;and this was the
      deeply confusing thing&mdash;she could not formulate her feeling for
      Brachey. She couldn't admit that she loved him. The thought of giving her
      life into his keeping&mdash;one day, should he come to her with clean
      hands; should he ask&mdash;was not to be entertained at all. But she
      couldn't think of him without excitement; and that excitement, last night
      and to-day, was the dominant fact in her life. She had no plans in which
      he figured. She was vaguely bent on forgetting him. During the night she
      had regretted her promise to meet him once more alone. Yet she had given
      that promise. Given the same situation she would&mdash;she knew with a
      touch of bewilderment that this was so&mdash;promise again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty looked appealingly at Mr. Boatwright. Then, meeting with no
      sympathy, she drew up her little figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said he was coming here for tiffin, Mrs. Boatwright?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The woman glanced out at the courtyard. &ldquo;Any moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shan't come into the dining-room.&rdquo; And Betty turned to leave the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a moment! Am I to take that as an answer? Are you promising?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hetty turned; hesitated; then, suddenly, impulsively, came across the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Boatwright,&rdquo; she said unsteadily&mdash;her eyes were filling&mdash;&ldquo;would
      it do any good for me to talk right out with you? Probably I do need
      advice.&rdquo; She faltered momentarily, shocked by the expression on that
      nearly square face. &ldquo;Oh, it isn't a terribly serious situation. It really
      isn't. But that man is honest. He has led an unhappy, solitary life...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice died out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you said he was <i>married!</i>&rdquo; cried Mrs. Boatwright explosively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But! But!' Child, what are you talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing in Betty's experience of life that could interpret to
      her mind such a point of view as that really held by the woman before her.
      She had no means of knowing that they were speaking across a gulf wider
      and deeper perhaps than has ever before existed between two generations;
      and that each of them, quite unconsciously, was an extreme example of her
      type. She turned again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a commotion out at the gate house that arrested her this time. She
      felt that curious excitement rising up in her heart and brain. Old Sun was
      springing up from the barber's stool, with his always great dignity
      brushing that public servitor aside. Then Brachey appeared, followed by
      Mr. Boatwright.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wife of that little man now caught the look on Betty's face, the
      sudden light in her eyes, and rose, alarmed, to her feet. Taking in the
      situation, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall send something up to your room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty moved her head wanly in the negative. It was no use explaining to
      this woman that she couldn't think of food. She moved slowly toward the
      door. She was unexpectedly tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked the older woman shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got to be by myself,&rdquo; said Betty, apparently less resentful now. It
      was more a rather faint statement of fact. And she went on out, not so
      much as answering Mrs. Boatwright's final &ldquo;But you will not promise?&rdquo; It
      wasn't even certain that she heard.
    </p>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>rs. Boatwright
      stood thinking. Betty had run up the stairs. The two men were coming
      slowly across the courtyard, talking. Or her husband was talking; she
      could hear his light voice. The other man was silent; a gloomy figure in
      knickerbockers. She studied him. Already he was catalogued in her mind,
      and permanently. For nothing that might happen to present Brachey in
      another light could ever, now, shake her judgment of him. No new evidence
      of ability or integrity in the man or of genuine misfortune in marriage,
      would influence her. No play of sympathy, no tolerant reflectiveness,
      would for a moment occupy her mind. She was a New Englander, with the old
      non-conformist British insistence on conduct and duty bred in her bone.
      Her emotional nature was almost the granite of her native lulls. And she
      was strong as that granite. She feared nothing, shrank from nothing, that
      could be classified as duty. No Latin flexibility ever softened her
      vigorous expression of independent thought. Her duty, now, was clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went out into the hall and opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men were just mounting the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; began her husband, sensing her mood, glancing up
      apprehensively, &ldquo;this is Mr. Brachey. He&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she, standing squarely in the doorway, &ldquo;I understand. Mr.
      Brachey, I can not receive you in this house. You, of course, know why. I
      must ask you to go at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she simply waited; commandingly. From her eyes blazed honest,
      invincible anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Boatwright caught his breath; stood motionless, very white; finally
      murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear, I'm sure you...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife merely glanced at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey stood as she had caught him, on the steps, one foot above the
      other. His face was expressionless. His eyes fastened on the woman a gaze
      that might have meant no more than cold curiosity, growing slowly into
      contempt. Then, after a moment, as quietly, he turned and descended the
      steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boatwright caught his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Mr. Brachey&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elmer!&rdquo; cried his wife shortly. &ldquo;Let him go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Brachey had already shaken off the detaining hand. He marched straight
      across the court, stepped into the gate house, and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty, all hurt confusion, had lingered in the second floor hall. At the
      first sound of Mrs. Boatwright's firm voice, she stepped, her brain a
      tangle of little indecisions, to the stair rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran lightly to the front window and watched Jonathan Brachey as he
      walked away. Then she shut herself in her own room, telling herself that
      the time had come to think it all out. But she couldn't think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Against the granite in Mrs. Boatwright Betty, who understood herself not
      at all, had to set a quick strong impulsiveness that was certain, given a
      little time, to work out in positive act. Very little time indeed now
      intervened between impulse and act. She scribbled a note, in pencil:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Mr. Brachey&mdash;I am going out to sketch in the tennis court. You
      can reach it by the little side street just beyond our gate house as you
      come from the city. Please do come!&mdash;Betty D.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went down the stairs again, portfolio under arm, and on to the gate
      house. Sun, as she had thought, knew at which inn the white gentleman was
      stopping, and at Miss Doane's request sent a boy with the chit.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI&mdash;EMOTION
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>RACHEY came
      suddenly into view, around the corner of the wall from the little side
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was dressed almost stiffly&mdash;not in knickerbockers now, but in what
      would be called at home a business suit, with stiff white collar and a
      soft but correct hat; and he carried a stick&mdash;like an Englishman,
      Betty thought, careful to the last of appearances. As if there were no
      such thing as danger; only stability. She might have been back in the
      comfortable New Jersey town and he a casual caller. And then, after taking
      him in, in a quick conflict of moods that left her breathless, she glanced
      hurriedly about. But only the blank compound wall met her gaze, and tile
      roofs, with the chimneys of the higher mission house peeping above
      foliage. The gate was but a narrow opening, near the farther end of the
      tennis court. No one could see. For that matter, it was to be doubted that
      any one in the compound knew she was here. And beyond the little street
      stood another blank wall.... And he had come!
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not know that she seemed very composed as she laid her portfolio
      on the camp stool and rose. Then her hand was in his. Her voice said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was nice of you to come. But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I asked for a meeting&mdash;for one meeting....&rdquo; Her eyes were down;
      he was set, as for a formal speech.... &ldquo;It was, as you may imagine,
      because a matter has arisen that seems to me of the greatest importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wondered what made him talk like that. As if determined to appeal to
      her mind. She couldn't listen; not with her mind; she was all feeling. He
      was a stranger, this man. Yet she had thought tenderly of him. It was
      difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't come alone?&rdquo; she asked, unaware that her manner, too, was
      formal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Oh, yes! I know the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it isn't safe. When I wrote... I heard what Mrs. Boatwright said. I
      was angry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was very rude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seemed as if I ought to get word to you&mdash;after that. I promised,
      of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your note surprised me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought I wouldn't keep my promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn't sure that you could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you hadn't heard from me, what would you have done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have left T'ainan this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how could you? Where could you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The provincial judge has assigned four soldiers to me. He was most
      courteous. He wants me to publish articles in America and England against
      the Ho Shan Company. He seems a very astute man. And he sent runners to
      the inn just now with presents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;what were they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some old tins of sauerkraut. A German traveler must have left them here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty smiled. Then, sober again, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you should have brought the soldiers with, you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. I preferred being alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't think you understand. It isn't safe to go about alone now.
      Not if you're a white man. I don't like to think that I've put you in
      danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't. It doesn't matter. As I was about to tell you... you must
      understand that I assume no interest on your part&mdash;I can't do that,
      of course&mdash;but after what happened, that night on the ship...&rdquo; He was
      ha\ing difficulty with this set speech of his. Betty averted her face to
      hide the warm color that came. Why on earth need he come out with it so
      heavily! Whatever had happened had happened, that was all!... His voice
      was going on. Something about a divorce. He was to be free shortly. He
      said that. He sounded almost cold about it, deliberate. And he had come
      clear out here to T'ainan just to say that. He <i>was</i> assuming, of
      course. To a painful degree. He seemed to feel that he owed it to her to
      make some sort of payment... for kissing her... and the payment,
      apparently, was to be himself. She was moved by a little wave of anger.
      She managed to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won't talk about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt that I must tell you. I'll go now, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as I am free I shall write you. I will ask you, then, to be my
      wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew himself up, at this, stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty's blush was a flush now. She gathered up her drawing tilings;
      deliberately arranged the sheets of paper in the portfolio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall say good-by...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Betty, rather shortly, not looking up &ldquo;You mustn't go like
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. Then, abruptly, he broke out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no way that I can stay. I would bring you only trouble. And it
      will be easier for me to go. Of course, I should never have come. It has
      been very upsetting, I haven't faced it honestly. I wanted to forget you.
      I've been tortured. And then I learned that you were in danger. I&mdash;can't
      talk about it!&rdquo; And he clamped his lips shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty opened her portfolio and slowly fingered the sheets of drawing
      paper. Her eyes filled; she had to keep them down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; Her voice was no more than a murmur. She said it
      again, a little louder: &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back to the inn. And then, perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't leave T'ainan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the difficulty. I couldn't save myself and leave you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On your account, I mean. We're safe enough; I've heard them talking at
      the house. Pao will protect us. And Chang, the tao-tai. But if you were to
      go out alone&mdash;on the highway&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is nothing. I have soldiers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said four soldiers. Father was attacked right here in the city, with
      Chang and his body-guard defending him. They even tore Chang's clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care about myself,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced up at him. She knew he spoke the truth, however bitter his
      spirit. He was talking on: &ldquo;Don't misunderstand me....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This journey has been a time of painful self-revelation. I used to think
      myself strong. That was absurd, of course. I am very weak. In this new
      trouble my will seems to have broken down. Yes, it has broken down; I may
      as well admit it. I had no right to fall in love with you. Already I have
      injured the life of one woman. Now, by merely coming out here in this
      ill-considered way, I am injuring yours.... The worst of it is these
      moments of terrible feeling. They make it impossible for me to reason. At
      one time I can really believe that a fatal accident out here&mdash;an
      accident to myself&mdash;would be the best thing that could happen for
      everybody concerned: but then, in a moment, I become inflamed with
      feeling, and desire, and a perfectly unreasonable hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; mused Betty, moved now by something near a thrill of power&mdash;a
      disturbing sort of power&mdash;&ldquo;if love is like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. I don't even know if this is love Part of the time I resent
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!... Well&mdash;yes, I can understand that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you resent me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my lucid moments I sec the thing clearly enough. It is simply an
      impossible situation. And I have added the final touch by coming out
      here.&rdquo; He seated himself on a block of stone, and rested his chin moodily
      on his two hands. &ldquo;That is what disturbs me&mdash;it frightens me. I have
      watched other men and women going through this queer confusion we call
      falling in love. I've pitied them. They were weak, helpless, surrendering
      the reasoning faculty to sheer emotion. Sometimes, I've thought of them as
      creatures caught in a net.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Betty breathed softly, &ldquo;I've never thought.. I wonder if it is like
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is with me. I see no happiness in it. I hope you will never have to
      live through what I've lived through these past few weeks. And now I sit
      here&mdash;&mdash;weakly&mdash;knowing I ought to go at once and never
      disturb you again. But the thought of going&mdash;of saying good-by&mdash;is
      terrible. It's one more thing I seem unable to face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty was struggling now against tumultuous thoughts. And without
      overcoming them, without even making headway against them, she spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't let you take all this on yourself. I must have&mdash;well made it
      hard for you, there on the ship. I enjoyed being with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was all she could say about that.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long, long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, with an inarticulate exclamation, he sprang up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Startled, all impulses, she caught his hand. His fingers tightened about
      hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; she asked, breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not away from T'ainan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It's the only thing. After all, it doesn't matter much what happens
      to any individual. We've got to take that chance. When my&mdash;when I'm&mdash;free,
      if I'm alive, and you're alive. I'll write you. I won't come&mdash;I'll
      write. Meanwhile, you can make up your mind. All I'll ask of you then is a
      decision. I'll accept it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her fingers were twisting around his. She couldn't look up at him, nor he
      down at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When shall you leave T'ainan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now&mdash;this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But... don't you see?..
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knelt beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dear child!&rdquo; he murmured unsteadily, &ldquo;can't you see what a trouble
      we're in? It's my fault&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no more your fault than mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but it is! I'm an experienced man. You're a girl. They're right in
      blaming me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People can't help their feelings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God, if they could! Don't you see, child, that I can't stay near you? I
      can't look at you&mdash;you're so little, so pretty, so charming! When I'm
      with you, all this feeling, all the warm feminine quality, all the
      beautiful magic that's been shut out of my life comes to me through you.
      It drives me crazy.... Betty, God forgive me! I can't help it&mdash;this
      once! It's good-by.&rdquo; He took her lightly, reverently, in his arms, and
      brushed his lips against her forehead. Then he arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, Betty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too late to start to-day. You can't travel Chinese roads at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll start early in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll&mdash;if you&mdash;I'll come out here this evening. I think I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;Betty!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be a little late. Perhaps about half past eight. They'll all be
      busy then.... Just for a little while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He considered this. &ldquo;It's wrong,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But what's the good of my
      deciding not to come. Of course I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You came clear to T'ainan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how about me!&rdquo; she broke out. &ldquo;I'm shut in a prison here. You're the
      only friend that's come&mdash;the only person I can talk with. Father is
      wonderful, but he's busy and worried, and I'm his daughter, and we can't
      talk much. And you and I&mdash;if you're going in the morning&mdash;we
      can't leave things&mdash;our very lives&rdquo;&mdash;her voice wavered&mdash;&ldquo;like
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll come,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And keep the soldiers with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if it is like a net,&rdquo; said she.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>HINA, in its
      vastness, its mystery, its permanence, its ceaseless ebb and flow of
      myriad, uncounted life, suggests the ocean. The surface is restless,
      ripped by universal family discord, whipped by gusts of passion from tong
      or tribe, upheaved by political storms, but everywhere in the unsounded
      depths lies the peace of submissiveness. Within its boundaries breathes
      sufficient power to overwhelm the world, yet only on the self-conscious
      surface is this power sensed and slightly used. Chinese life, in city and
      village, as in the teeming countryside, moves in disorganized poverty
      about its laborious daily tasks, little more aware of the surface
      political currents than are Crustacea at the bottom of the sea of ships
      passing overhead; while to these patient minds the mighty adventure of the
      Western World is no more than a breath upon the waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      This simile found a place among the darker thoughts of Griggsby Doane as
      he tramped down into the fertile valley of the Han. Behind him lay
      tragedy; yet on every hand the farmers were at work upon the narrow
      holdings that terraced the red hills to their summits. At each countryside
      well the half-naked coolies&mdash;two, three, or four of them&mdash;were
      turning windlasses and emptying buckets of water into stone troughs from
      which trickled little painstakingly measured streams to the sunbaked
      furrow of this or that or another field. The trains of asses anil camels
      wound ceaselessly up and down the road that led from the northern hills to
      T'ainan. The roadside vendors and beggars chanted their wares and their
      grievances. The villages, always indolent, lived on exactly as always,
      stirred only by noisy bargains or other trivial excitement. The naked
      children tumbled about. It w as hard to believe that here could be&mdash;had
      so lately been&mdash;violence and cruelty. It was simply one of the
      occasions, evidently, when no Lookers or hostile young men happened to be
      about to shout their familiar taunts at the white devil. Though the
      fighting of 1900, for that matter, had passed like a wave, leaving hardly
      more trace. Still more, at dusk, the outskirts of the great city stirred
      perplexing thoughts. The quiet of a Chinese evening was settling on shops
      and homes. Children's voices carried brightly over compound walls. Kites
      flew overhead. The music of stringed instalments floated pleasantly,
      faintly, to the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      And every quaint sight and sound was registered with a fresh vividness on
      Doane's highly strung nerves. He was tired; might easily, too easily,
      become irritable; a fact he sensed and struggled to guard against. Now, of
      all occasions in his life, he must exercise self-control. Difficult tasks
      lay directly ahead. One would be the talk with Pao Ting Chuan about the So
      T'ung massacre. Pao was, in his Oriental way, friendly; but his way was
      Oriental. It would be necessary to meet him at every evasive turn;
      necessary to read behind every courteous speech of a cultivated and
      charming gentleman the complex motivation of a mandarin skilled in the
      intricate relationships of the Court of Peking. Helping avert trouble was
      one matter; Pao could doubtless, or apparently, be counted on to that
      extent; but assuming full responsibility for the taking of white life and
      the destruction of white man's property, was a vastly more complicated
      matter. No other sort of human creature is so skilful at evading
      responsibility as the Chinaman; this, perhaps, because responsibility,
      once accepted, is, under the Chinese tradition and system, inescapable....
      Another task, of course, would be the telling Boatwright of his personal
      disaster. It still seemed better to do this before the news could drift
      around in some vulgar, disruptive way from Shanghai. He couldn't plan this
      talk, not yet; but a way would doubtless present itself. He stood before
      his God, in his own strong heart, convicted of sin. There had been
      moments, during the tramp southward, when he found himself welcoming this
      nearly public self-arraignment with a bitter eagerness. But at such
      moments pictures of Betty rose in his mind, and of the gentle beautiful
      wife of his youth&mdash;wistful, delicately traced pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face would change then; the lines would deepen and a look of torment,
      of wild hurt animal strength that was new, would appear in and about his
      deep-shaded eyes.
    </p>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s he drew near the
      mission compound his stride shortened and slowed. Once he stopped, and for
      a brief bme stood motionless, not heeding the curious Chinese who passed
      (dim figures with soft-padded shoes), his lips drawn tightly together over
      nervous mutterings that nearly, once or twice, came out as sounds. He was
      not a man who talks out overwrought feelings on the public way. The
      tendency alarmed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came deliberately into the gate house. Here, talking in some excitement
      with old Sun, were four or five of the servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused to ask what was the matter. To take hold again, to step so
      quickly into his position as head of the compound, brought a sense of
      relief. That would be habit functioning. A moment later, his confusion was
      deeper than before; in one of those quick flashes that can illuminate and
      occupy the inner mind while the outer is engaged with the brisk affairs of
      life, he was wondering how soon these men would know what he was, what
      pitiful sort he had overnight become; and what they would think of him,
      they who now obeyed and loved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They told him the gossip of the streets. Those strange soldiers, Lookers,
      from beyond the western mountains, had been coming of late to the yamen of
      old Kang Hsu. Kang, so ran the local story, had reviewed these troops
      within the twelve hours, witnessing their incantations, giving them his
      approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane said what little he could to quiet their fears; he even managed a
      rather austere smile; then passed on into the courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Cassin came slowly down the steps from the dispensary, her keys
      jingling in her hand. She was a spare, competent woman, deeply consecrated
      to her work, but not lacking in kindliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Doane!&rdquo; she said. Then, &ldquo;How did you find things at So T'ung?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood a moment, looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very bad,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not&mdash;well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane inclined his head. &ldquo;Yes, Jen is gone&mdash;and twelve to fifteen
      others. Shot or burned. One helper escaped. I could get word of no others.
      One of Monsieur Pourmont's engineers helped very bravely in the defense,
      but was finally clubbed to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Cassin stood silent; then drew in her breath sharply. The keys
      jingled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she murmured in a broken voice, &ldquo;That <i>is</i> bad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It couldn't be worse. How is it here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;she pursed her lips&mdash;&ldquo;I'm afraid we've all been getting
      a little nervous. It's well you're back. We need you. The servants are
      jumpy....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gathered that, in the gate house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder... in the fighting at So T'ung there must have been a good many
      wounded...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Among the attackers, yes; the Lookers themselves, and village rowdies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was wondering... mightn't it be a good thing for me to go up there and
      take charge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the effect it might have on the people, I mean. Wouldn't it help
      restore their confidence in us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Doctor. The people&mdash;except the young men&mdash;haven't changed.
      Trouble will come wherever the Lookers go. No, your place is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once in the mission residence, Doane hurried up the two flights of stairs
      to his own rooms. He met no one; the door of Boatwright's study was
      closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they needed him. The strain was shaking their monde a little. It was
      really not surprising, after 1900. But if they needed him it was no time
      to indulge his own emotions. He would have to take hold again, that was
      all; perhaps keep hold, letting the news that was to be to him so evil
      come up as it might. He sighed as he closed his door. Some sort of a scene
      there must be; at least a talk with the Boatwrights about So T'ung and
      about the local problem.... One thing he could do; remove his dusty
      clothing, wash, put on fresh things. It would help a little, just the
      physical refreshment. He went back to the door and locked it.....
      Boatwright would be up, almost certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very shortly came the familiar hesitant tapping. For years the little man
      had made his presence known in that same faintly timid way. It was
      irritating.... Doane called out that he would be down soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh... all right... thank you!&rdquo; Thus Boatwright, outside the door. And
      then he moved slowly, uncertainly, down the stairs.
    </p>
    <h3>
      3
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>oatwright was
      sitting idle at his desk, rolling a pencil about. It was an old roll-top
      desk from Michigan via Shanghai. Doane closed the door, quietly, and drew
      up a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better read this.&rdquo; Boatwright spread a telegram on the desk. &ldquo;I
      haven't told the others. It came late this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The message was from Mrs. Nacy, acting dean of the little college at Hung
      Chan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Several hundred Lookers&rdquo;&mdash;it ran&mdash;&ldquo;broke into compound this
      noon and took all our food, slightly injuring cook and helper who
      resisted; they order us to send all girl students home; remain at present
      carousing near compound; very threatening; commander forbids any
      communication with you as they seem to fear you and your influence at
      Judge's yamen, though boasting that Treasurer now rules province and that
      Judge will be fortunate to escape with his life; wish greatly you could be
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane, sifting very quietly, shading his eyes with a powerful hand, read
      the message twice; then asked, calmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you notified Pao?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet. Your message came several hours earlier. It seemed wise to wait
      for yuu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane considered the matter; then reached for red paper, ink pot and
      brush, and wrote, in Chinese, the equivalent of the following note:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg to report that a band of Lookers at So T'ung, assisted by local
      young men, killed Jen Ling Pu and about fourteen others, including white
      engineer named Beggins from compound of Monsieur Pourmont at Ping Yang.
      Considerable property destroyed. Several buildings burned to ground.
      Further, to-day, comes a report of attack on the Mission College at Hung
      Chan, with urgent appeal for help. I am going to Hung Chan at once,
      to-night, and must beg of Your Excellency immediate support from local
      officials and troops. I must further beg to advise Your Excellency that I
      am reporting these unfortunate events to the American Minister at Peking
      by telegraph to-night and to suggest that only the greatest promptness and
      firmness on your part can now avert widespread trouble which threatens to
      bow the head of China once more with shame in the dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;James Griggsby Doane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He struck a bell then, and to the servant who entered gave instructions
      regarding the etiquette to be observed in promptly delivering the note at
      the yamen of the provincial judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am worried, I'll admit, about Kang,&rdquo; observed Boatwright, when the
      servant had gone. He said this without looking up, rolling the pencil back
      and forth, back and forth. His voice was light and husky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deane, watching him, felt now that his own task was to forget self
      utterly. It was beginning, even, to seem the pleasantly selfish course.
      The trip down to Hung Chan he welcomed. He would drive himself
      mercilessly; it would be an escaping from his thoughts. Moments had come,
      during the walk from So T'ung, when for the first time in his life he
      understood suicide. So many men fell back on it during the tragic
      disillusionments of middle life. The trouble with suicide, of course, this
      sort, was the element of cowardice. He wasn't beaten. Not yet. At least,
      he had strength left, and physical courage. No, action was the thing. It
      was the sort of contribution he was best fitted to give these helpless,
      frightened people here. As to Betty, he would give to the limits of his
      great strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he answered Boatwright with a manner of calm confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kang is putting up a fight, of course, but Pao will prove too strong for
      him. At least, there's no good in believing anything else, Elmer. It's the
      position we've got to take. I'll get into my walking clothes again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not going to Hung Chan alone, to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It's the quickest way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you need sleep&mdash;a few hours, at least?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I was too late at So T'ung.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was not your fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Still... I'll go right along.&rdquo; Doane got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you could give me a few minutes more there's another matter. I'm
      afraid you'll regard it as rather important. It's&mdash;difficult....&rdquo; And
      then, instead of continuing, he fell to rolling the pencil, and gazing at
      it. His color rose a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a light knock at the door. Neither man responded. After a moment
      the door opened a little way, and Mrs. Boatwright looked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!...&rdquo; she exclaimed, then: &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Doane!... Elmer, have
      you spoken of that matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just beginning to, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boatwright, after a silence, came in and closed the door softly
      behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Doane hasn't much time.&rdquo; Boatwright's voice was low, tremulous.
      &ldquo;Matters at So Thing are as bad as they could be. And he is going down to
      Hung Chan now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night?&rdquo; asked the wife, rather sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane inclined his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what are we to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr Doane,&rdquo; put in the husband, &ldquo;has given instructions that we are to
      stay here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;instructions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Doane gravely. And he courteously explained: &ldquo;The situation is
      developing too rapidly for us to get all the others in to T'ainan. And we
      can't desert them. Not yet. You will certainly be safer here than you
      would be on the road. Hung Chan is only eighteen miles. I shall be back
      within twenty-four hours, probably to-morrow evening. Then we will hold a
      conference and decide finally on a course. We may be reduced to demanding
      an escort to Ping Yang, telegraphing the others to save themselves as best
      they can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boatwright soberly considered the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks like nineteen hundred all over again,&rdquo; Boatwright muttered
      huskily, without looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Doane, &ldquo;it won't be the same. The only thing we positively know
      is that history never repeats itself. We'll take it as it comes.&rdquo; He
      didn't see Mrs. Boatwright's sharp eyes taking him in as he said this.
      &ldquo;I'll leave you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just this other matter,&rdquo; said the wife, more briskly. &ldquo;I won't keep you
      long. But I don't feel free to handle the situation in my own way, and&mdash;well,
      something must be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said the husband, &ldquo;there's a man here&mdash;a queer American&mdash;he
      turned up&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elmer!&rdquo; the wife interrupted, &ldquo;if you will let me.... It is a man your
      daughter met on the ship coming out, Mr. Doane. Evidently a case of
      infatuation....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a journalist&mdash;has written works on British administration in
      India, I believe&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elmer! Please! The fact is, the man has deliberately followed Betty out
      here. There is some understanding between them&mdash;something that should
      be got at. The man is married. Betty admits that&mdash;she seems to be
      intimately in his confidence. He came rushing out here without so much as
      a passport. Elmer has had to give up a good deal of time to setting him
      right at Pao's yamen. I very properly refused to accept him here as a
      guest, whereupon Hetty got word to him secretly and they have been meeting&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out in the tennis court!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night I found them there myself. I sent him away, and brought Betty
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell it all, dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will. Mr. Doane must know the facts. The man was kissing her. He
      offered no apology. And Betty was defiant. She seemed then to fear the man
      would not appear again, but in some way she found him this afternoon out
      in the side street. They must have been there together for some time,
      walking back and forth, talking earnestly. I had other things to do, of
      course. I couldn't devote all my time to watching her. And it would seem,
      if she had any normal sense of... I secured a promise then from Betty that
      she would not meet him again until after your return. The man, however,
      would promise nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On few occasions in her intensely busy life had Mrs. Boatwright been so
      voluble. But she was excited and perhaps a little prurient; for to such
      severe self-discipline as hers there are opposite and sometimes equal
      reactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something must be done, and at once.&rdquo; She appeared to be bringing her
      speech to a conclusion. &ldquo;The man impressed me as persistent and quite
      shameless. He is unquestionably exerting a dangerous power over the girl.
      Even in times like these, I am sure that you, as her father, will feel
      that a strong effort must be made to save her. I needn't speak of the
      whispers that are already loose about the compound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through all this, Doane, his face wholly expressionless except for a
      stunned look about the eyes and perhaps a sad settling about the mouth,
      looked quietly from wife to husband and back again. They seemed utter
      strangers, these two. With disconcerting abruptness he discovered that he
      disliked them both.... Another thought that came was of the scene of
      desolation he had left at So T'ung. After that, what mattered, what little
      human thing! Then it occurred to his dazed mind that this wouldn't do.
      Suddenly he could see Betty&mdash;her charm and grace, her bright pretty
      ways, with his inner eye; and again his spirit was tom and tortured as all
      during the night, back there in the hills. If only he could recall the
      prayers that used to rise so easily and earnestly from his eager heart!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is she now?&rdquo; he asked, outwardly so calm as to stir resentment in
      the woman before him. She replied, acidly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In her room. If she hasn't slipped out again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She promised, I believe you said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was uttered so quietly that a slow moment passed before it reached
      home. Then Mrs. Boatwright replied, with less emphasis:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She promised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is the man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At an inn, somewhere inside the walls. Sun would know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Boatwright fumbled among the papers on his desk, and found a card which he
      passed over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane looked thoughtfully at it, then slipped it into a pocket; said,
      quiet, deathly sober, &ldquo;You may look for me sometime to-morrow night. We
      will make our final arrangements then. Meantime you had all better get
      what rest you can.&rdquo; Then he left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Husband and wife looked at each other. The man's lids drooped first. He
      began rolling the pencil. Finally he said, listlessly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably it would be wise to sort out these papers&mdash;get the letters
      and reports straight. If we should go, there wouldn't be much time for
      packing.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>oane went directly
      to Betty's door, and knocked. She came at once, in her pretty kimono;
      peeped out at him; cried softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dad! You're safe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear. I have one more trip, a short one. It will be all I can do.
      To-morrow night I'll be back for good. Take care of yourself, little
      girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;oh, yes! But I shall worry about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Never worry. I'll be back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That seemed to be all he could say. She, too, was still. The silence
      lengthened, grew into a conscious thing in his mind anti hers. Finally he
      took a hesitating backward step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be off, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad&mdash;wait!&rdquo; She stood erect, her head drawn back, looking directly
      at him out of curiously bright eyes. Her abundant hair flowed down about
      her shoulders... But he thought of her eyes. They were frank, brave, and
      very young and eager and bright. Somewhere within her slim little frame
      she had a store of fine young courage; he knew it now, and felt a thrill
      that was at once hope and pain. He had to fight back tears.... She was
      going to tell him. Yes, she was plunging wonderfully into it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's one thing, Dad! I'm sorry&mdash;I oughtn't to make you think of
      other things now. But if we could only have a little talk....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He managed to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a day more, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I suppose we should wait... though...&rdquo; He stepped forward, drew her
      to him, and in an uprush of exquisite tenderness kissed her forehead;
      then, with an odd little sound that might almost have been a sob, he
      rushed off, descended the stairs, and went out the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the window she saw his dim figure crossing the court. At the gate
      house he paused and called aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of the servants came; she could see their quaintly colored paper
      lanterns bobbing about. One of them went into the gate house and came out
      again. He was struggling with something. She strained her eyes against the
      glass. Oh. yes&mdash;he was getting into his long coat; that was all.
      Apparently he went out, this man, with her father.... The other colored
      lantern bobbed back into the gate house, and the compound settled again
      into calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane, though he could not talk with his daughter, could talk directly and
      bluntly to the man named Brachey, who had rushed out here incontinent
      after her He knew this; was alive with a slow swelling anger that came to
      him as a perverse sort of blessing after the cumulative emotional torment
      of the past three days.

      CHAPTER XIII&mdash;THE PLEDGE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N the morning of
      that same day&mdash;while Griggsby Doane was striding down the mountain
      road from So T'ung to T'ainan-fu&mdash;Jonathan Brachey sat in his room at
      the inn trying to read, trying to write, counting the minutes until two
      o'clock at which hour Betty would be waiting in the tennis court, when
      John slipped in with a small white card bearing the printed legend, in
      English:
    </p>
    <h3>
      <i>MR. PO</i>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <i>Interpreter and Secretary</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Yamen of His Excellency the Provincial Judge T'ainan-fu</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Po proved to be a tall, slim, rather elegant young man in conventional
      plain robe, black skull-cap and large spectacles, who met Brachey's stiff
      greeting with a broad smile and a wholly Western grip of the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d' do!&rdquo; he said eagerly: &ldquo;How d' do!&rdquo; Then he glanced about at the
      two worn old chairs, the crumbling walls of the sun-dried brick with their
      soiled, ragged motto scrolls, the dirty matting on the <i>kang</i>, and
      slowly shook his head. &ldquo;You're not comfortable as all get-out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If there was in Mr. Po's speech a softness of intonation and a faint
      difficulty with the <i>r's</i> and <i>l's</i>, the faults were not so
      marked as to demand changes of spelling in setting it down. He accepted a
      cigarette. Brachey lighted his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite at home in English,&rdquo; remarked Brachey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! English is my professional matter in hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have lived abroad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! But at Tientsin Anglo-Chinese College, I made consumption largely
      of midnight oil. And among English people society I have broken the ice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey settled back in the angular chair; pulled at his pipe; thought.
      The man was here for a purpose, of course. But from that slightly eager
      manner, it seemed reasonable to infer that among his motives was a desire
      to practise and exhibit his English, a curious mixture of book phrases and
      coast slang, with here and there the Chinese sentence-structure showing
      through. And he offered an opportunity to study the local problem that
      Brachey mentally leaped at.
    </p>
    <p>
      So these two fell into chat, the smiling young Chinese gentleman and the
      austere Westerner. Mr. Po, speaking easily, without emphasis, his casual
      manner suggesting that nothing mattered much&mdash;not old or new, life or
      death&mdash;revealed, through the words he so lightly used, stirring
      enthusiasms. And Brachey observed him through narrowed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, thought the journalist, before him, smoking a cigarette, sat modern
      China; in robe and queue, speaking of the future but ridden by the past;
      using strong words but with no fire, no urge or glow in the voice; as if
      eager to hope without the substance of hope; at once age and youth,
      smiling down the weary centuries at himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been expressed to me that you are literature man.&rdquo; Thus Mr. Po.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey's head moved downward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is quite wonderful. If you will tell me the names of certain of your
      books I will give myself great delight in reading them. I read English
      like the devil&mdash;all the time. I'm crazy about Emerson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey led him on. They talked of Russia and England, of the new railways
      in China, of truculent Japan, of Edison, much of Roosevelt. Mr. Po
      suggested a walk; and they mounted the city wall, sat on the parapet and
      talked on; the Chinaman always smiling, nerveless, his calm, easily
      flowing voice without body or emphasis. Brachey finally succeeded in
      guiding the man to his own topic, China.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It puzzles and bewilders,&rdquo; said Mr. Po. &ldquo;China must leap like grasshopper
      over the many centuries. To railways one may turn for beneficent
      assistance. And also to missionaries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm surprised to hear you say that. I supposed all China was opposed to
      the missionaries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not dwell at present time upon their religion practises. That may be
      all to the good&mdash;I can not say. But the domicle of each and every
      missionary may be termed civilization propaganda center. Here are found
      books, medicines, lamps. Your eyes have discerned enveloping gloom of
      Chinese cities by night. Think, I beg of you, what difference it will be
      when illumination brightens all. Our people do not like these things, it
      is true. They descend avidly into superstitions. They make a hell of a
      fuss. But that fuss is growing pain. China must grow, though suffering
      accumulate and dismay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to think of it,&rdquo; mused Brachey aloud, &ldquo;superstition isn't stopping
      the railroads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Po snapped his fingers, smilingly. &ldquo;A fig and thistle for
      superstition!&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Take good look at the railways! What
      happened? In every field of China, as you know, stand grave mounds of
      honorable ancestral worshiping. It will break heart of China to desecrate
      those grave mounds. It will bring down untold misery upon ancestors. But
      when they build Hankow-Peking Rahway, very slick speculator employed
      observation upon surveyors and purchased up claims against railway for
      bringing misery upon ancestors and sold them to railway company at
      handsome profit to himself. And, sir, do you know what it set back company
      to desecrate ancestors of China? It set back twelve dollars per ancestor.
      And that slick speculator he is now millionaire. He erects imposing house
      at Shanghai and elaborates dinners to white merchants. It is said that he
      will soon be compradore and partner in most pretentious English Hong....
      No, the superstition will have to go. It will go like the chaff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this big change will take a little time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time? Oh, yes, of course! But what is time to China! A few centuries!
      They are nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few centuries are something to me,&rdquo; observed Brachey dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! And to me. That is different. There are times to come of running
      to and fro and hubbub. It is not easy to adjust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not,&rdquo; said Brachey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For myself, I would like to get away. I have observed with too great
      width customs of white peoples, I have perused with too diligent attention
      many English books as well as those of French and German authorship, to
      find contentment in Chinese habit ways. I would appreciate to voyage
      freely to America. If I might ask, is not there an exception made under
      so-called Chinese Exclusion Act in instance of attentive student and
      gentleman who finds himself by no means dependent upon finance
      arrangements of certain others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don't know,&rdquo; said Brachey. &ldquo;You'd have to talk with somebody up
      at the legation about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But up at legation somebodies make always assumption never to know a darn
      thing about anything.&rdquo; Mr Po laughed easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have employed great thought concerning this topic,&rdquo; he went on, with
      mounting assurance. &ldquo;It is here and now time of beginning upset in Hansi,
      as perhaps as well in all China. At topmost pinnacle of Old Order here
      stands Kang, the treasurer. It can not, indeed, be said that for ennobling
      ideas of New Order he cares much of a damn. And he is miserably jealous of
      His Excellency, Pao Ting Chuan. But Pao is very strong. Sooner or later he
      will pin upon Kang defeat humiliation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You feel sure Pao will be able to do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! Pao is cat, Kang is mouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hmm!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes indeed! But it is nothing to me. Nothing in world! I have laid before
      His Excellency desires of my heart. He expresses willing courtesy. If I
      may make voyage freely he will make best of it. And not unlike myself he
      has perceived half-notion that if I turn to you for wisdom advice you will
      not turn cold shoulder and throw me down.&rdquo; Catching the opposition behind
      Brachey's slightly knit brows, he added hastily, &ldquo;I have no need. That is
      to say, I'm not broke. And&mdash;with this thought plan I have made
      transferrence of certain monies to Hongkong Bank at Shanghai where no
      revolution or hell of a row can snatch it from my outstretched hands. With
      but a nod from your head, sir, and also with permission of His Excellency,
      I could make sneak out of province as your servant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey, after some thought, said he would take the proposal under
      consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the walk back to the inn he contrived to hold the interpreter's
      chatter closely to the ferment in the province.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kang, it appeared, was openly backing the Lookers now. His yamen enclosure
      swarmed with ragged soldiers from the West who foraged among the shops for
      food and trinkets, and beat or shot the inoffensive Chinese merchants by
      way of emphasizing rather casually their privileged status in the capital
      city. Down the river, near Hung Chan, a more considerable concentration of
      the strange troops was taking place. Hung Chan was also the rendezvous for
      the local young men who had been initiated into the Looker bands. Rumors
      were flying of a general massacre to come of the white and secondary (or
      native) Christians. There was even talk of a political alliance with the
      organizers of rebellion in the South against the Imperial Manchu
      Government and of a triumphant march to the coast. A phrase that might be
      translated as &ldquo;China for the Chinese&rdquo; had come into circulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey grew more and more thoughtful as he listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Pao is so strong, why does he permit matters to go so far?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Po laughed. &ldquo;His Excellency will in his own good time get move on
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hmm!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only yesterday I myself was pinched on street by Western soldiers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pinched?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seized and arrested. Taken up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey raised his eyebrows; but Mr Po smiled easily on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! They called me secondary Christian. They ran me in before low
      woman, a courtesan. They have told Kang that this courtesan is
      second-sighted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clairvoyant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is now firm belief of Kang on mere say-so of cheap skates. This
      courtesan has been conveyed to treasurer's yamen where with eunuchs and
      concubines to attend and soldiers to stand sentry-go she now holds forth
      to beat the Dutch. All perfectly absurd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this creature sat in judgment over you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! Not a day since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was her decision?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again that easy laugh. &ldquo;Oh, she decree that I am to kick bucket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Execute you, eh? You take it lightly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nothing. I will tell you. In companionship with me was my bosom
      friend, Chili T'ang, who is third son of well-known censor of Peking,
      Chili Chang Pu. It was Chih who got hustle on to yamen of His Excellency&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By His Excellency you mean Pao?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In every instance, if you please! Well, like a shot His Excellency acted
      in my behalf. In person and with full retinue grandeur panoply he set
      forth to pay visit to old rascal Kang, carrying as gift of utmost personal
      esteem ancient ring for thumb of jade that Kang had long made goo-goo eyes
      at. And he asked of Kang as favor mark to himself that he be let known
      instanter, right away, if any of soldiers from his yamen should behave
      with unpleasantness toward new soldiers of Kang, for new soldiers of Kang
      had come to T'ainan-fu out of far country and not unnaturally felt
      homesick and were not in each instance in step with customs of our city.
      And he made explanation as well that he would instruct his secretary, Po
      Sui-an, to bring news quicker than Johnny get your gun if his own soldiers
      should act up freshly or become stench in the nostrils.... Well, you see,
      sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am Po Sui-an! It was rebuke like ton of brick, falling on all but
      face of old Kang. It has been insisted to me that Kang trembled like
      swaying aspen reed as he made high sign to attendant mandarins. And then
      His Excellency set forth that I had just stepped out on brief journey but
      would shortly be back and that he would then instruct me with determined
      vigor.... Such is His Excellency, a statesman of stiff upper lip. A most
      wise guy! Thus he served notice on that old reprobate that he will strike
      when iron is hot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They released you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At once. On return of His Excellency, to his yamen. There was I, slick as
      whistle!&rdquo;,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very interesting. But if Kang continues to bring in soldiers from the
      West, how is Pao going to strike with any hope of success? Is he, too,
      marshaling an army?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! But you see, I come to call upon you, with you I walk freely
      about streets. At Kang I thumb my nose and tell him go chase himself. Pao
      will protect myself and you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But as I understand it, Kang officially ranks Pao.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! But that is nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks like a little something to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! I will ask you for brief moment to glance sidelong at Forbidden
      City of Peking. There during long devil of a while Eastern Empress
      officially ranked Western Empress, but I would call your attention to
      insignificant matter that it was not Western Empress&mdash;she whom you
      dub Empress Dowager&mdash;that turned up her toes most opportunely to
      daisies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see! Then it is believed that the Empress Dowager had the Eastern
      Empress killed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could not ask that she neglect wholly her fences.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.... no, I suppose you couldn't ask that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is great woman. She will not permit that another person put her on
      the blink. It is so with His Excellency. A dam' big man! We shall see!&rdquo;...
      He hesitated, smiling a thought more eagerly than before. They had reached
      the gate of the inn compound. His quick eye had caught increasing signs of
      preoccupation in Brachey's manner. Finally, laughing again, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'There is one other little bagatelle. An utter absurdity! I have made
      preparation for lecture in English about China. Name of it is 'Pigtail and
      Chop-stick.' When I read it at college I must say they held sides and
      shook like jelly bowl. On that occasion it was made plain to me by men of
      thought that it is peach of a lecture. It's a scream.&rdquo; His laugh indicated
      now an apologetic self-consciousness. &ldquo;It was said that in America my
      lecture would be knockout, that Chinaman treading with humor the lyceum
      would make novelty excitement. Indeed, by gentleman of Customs
      Administration this was handed me....&rdquo; He fumbled inside his gown, finally
      producing a frayed bit of ruled paper, evidently torn from a pocket
      note-book, on which was written in pencil: &ldquo;Try the J. B. Pond Lyceum
      Bureau, New York City.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since it was expressed to me,&rdquo; he hurried to add, &ldquo;that American
      journalist notability was in our midst, I have amused myself with fool
      thought that you would run eyes over it and let me have worst of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a pleasure,&rdquo; said Brachey, civilly enough but with
      considerable dismissive force, extending his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Mr. Po, smiling but something crestfallen, sauntered away.
    </p>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t ten o'clock that
      night Brachey sat in the angular chair, his <i>Bible in Spain</i> lying
      open on his knees, his weary face deeply shadowed and yellow-gray in the
      flickering light of the native lamp on the table beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      John tapped at the door; came softly in; stood, holding the door to behind
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; cried Brachey irritably. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man wanchee see you. Can do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man?... What man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No savvy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;China man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No China man. White man. Too big.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey sprang up; dropped his book on the table with a bang; brushed John
      aside and opened the door. The only light out there came slanting down
      from a brilliant moon. Dimly outlined as shadowy masses were the now
      familiar objects of the inn courtyard&mdash;the row of pack-saddles over
      by the stable, the darkly moving heads of the horses ami mules behind the
      long manger, the two millstones on their rough standard; above these the
      roofs of curving tile and a glimpse of young foliage. Then, after a
      moment, he sensed movement and peered across, beyond the stable, toward
      the street gates. A man was approaching; a huge figure of a man, six feet
      five or six inches in height, broad of shoulder, firm of tread; stood now
      before him. He carried something like a soldier's pack on his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you come here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey on the door-step found his eyes level with those of his caller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Brachcy?&rdquo; The voice had the ring of power in it. Brachey's nerves
      tightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Mr. Doane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you please come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      John slipped away. Doane entered; moved to the table; turned. Brachey
      closed the door and faced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will perhaps wish to take off your pack,&rdquo; he said, with bare
      civility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane disposed of this remark with a jerk of his head. &ldquo;I have very little
      time to waste on you,&rdquo; he said bruskly. &ldquo;What are you doing in T'ainan?
      Why did you come here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0005" id="linkimage-0005"> </a>
    </p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0231.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      There was a long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, if you won't answer.&rdquo;... Doane's voice rasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey raised his hand. &ldquo;I was considering your question,&rdquo; he broke in
      coldly. &ldquo;While it is not the whole truth, it will probably save time to
      say that I came to see your daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would have liked to express in his voice some thing of the desperate
      tenderness that he felt. The experiences of the preceding evening and of
      the afternoon just past&mdash;the glimpses he had had into the heart of a
      girl, his little storms of anger against Mrs. Boatwright and all her kind,
      followed in each instance by other little storms of anger against himself&mdash;had
      finally swept him from the last rational mooring place out into the
      bottomless, boundless sea of emotion. He had found himself, already
      to-night, a storm-tossed soul without compass or bearings or rudder. He
      burned to see Betty again. It had taken all that was left of his will to
      keep from charging out once more across the city, out through the wall, to
      the mission compound. He was shaken, humbled, frightened. To such a nature
      as Brachey's&mdash;stubbornly aloof from human contacts, sensitively
      self-sufficient&mdash;this was really a terrible experience. It was the
      worst storm of his life. He felt&mdash;had felt at times during the
      evening, as he tried to brace himself for this scene that he knew had to
      come within the twenty-four hours&mdash;something near tenderness for the
      man who was Betty's father. There were even moments when he looked forward
      to the meeting with the hope that through the father's feelings he might
      be helped in finding his lost self.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had tried, sitting among the shadows, to build up a picture of the man.
      Several of these he had constructed, to meet each of which he felt he
      could hold himself in a mental attitude of frankness and even sympathy.
      But each of these pictures was but an elaboration of familiar missionary
      types. All were what he considered&mdash;or once had considered&mdash;weak,
      or over-earnest to the borders of fanaticism, or cautious little men, or
      narrow formalists... men like Boatwright And without realizing, it, too,
      he had counted on either real or counterfeited Christian forbearance. The
      only thing he had feared might come up to disturb him was intolerance,
      like that of Boatwright's wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that, of course, you couldn't reason, couldn't talk at all.... What
      he really wanted to do, burned to do, was to tell the exact truth. He had
      passed the point where he could give Betty up; he would have to fight for
      her now, whatever happened. His one great fear had been that Betty's
      father would be incapable of entertaining the truth dispassionately,
      fairly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the actual Doane cleared his over-charged brain as a mountain storm
      will clear murky air. Here was a giant of a man who meant business. Back
      of that strong face, back of the deep voice, Brachey felt a pressure of
      anger. It was not Christian forbearance; it was vigor and something more;
      something that perhaps, probably, would come out before they were through
      with each other. There was a restless power in the man, a wild animal
      pacing there behind the slightly clouded eyes. Even in the blinding fire
      of his own love for Betty he could look out momentarily and see or feel
      that this giant was burning too. And what he saw or felt, turned his heart
      to ice and his brain to tempered metal. Sympathy would have reached
      Brachey this night; weakness, blundering, might have reached him. But now,
      of all occasions, he would not be intimidated.. .. He felt the change
      coming over him, dreaded it, even resisted it; but was powerless to check
      it. The man proposed to beat him down. No one had ever yet done that to
      Jonathan Brachey. And so, though he tried to speak with simple frankness
      in saying, &ldquo;I came to see your daughter,&rdquo; the words came out coldly,
      tinged with defiance, between set lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might easily mean a fight of some sort, Brachey reflected. This
      mountain of a man could crush him, of course. Primitive emotion charged
      the air as each deliberately stud'ed the other.... It would hardly matter
      if he should be crushed. There were no police in T'airan to protect white
      men from each other. His wife would be relieved; a queer, bitter sob rose
      part way in his throat at the thought. There was no one else... save
      Betty. Betty would care! And this man was her father! It was terrible....
      He was struggling now to attain a humility his austere life had never
      known; if only he could trample down his savage pride, hear the man out,
      swallow every insult! But in this struggle, at first, he failed. Like a
      soldier he faced the huge fighting man with a pack on his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew my daughter on the steamer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before that&mdash;in America?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something between you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a married man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane, his face working a very little, his arms stiff and straight at his
      sides, came a step nearer. Brachey lifted his chin and stared up the more
      directly at him. &ldquo;You seem to have a little honesty, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am honest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far has this gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane took another step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't I kill you?&rdquo; he breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that Brachey first caught the full force of Doane's emotional
      torment. To say that he did not flinch, inwardly, would be untrue; but all
      that Doane saw was a slight hesitation before the cold reply came: &ldquo;I can
      not answer that question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can answer the other. How far has this gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey again clamped his lips shut. The situation, to him, had become
      inexplicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane's eyes blazed down wildly. And Doane's voice broke through the
      restraint he had put upon it as he cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you harmed my little girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey was still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer me!&rdquo; Doane's great hand came down on his shoulder. &ldquo;Have you
      harmed her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey's body trembled under that hand; he was fighting himself, fighting
      the impulse to strike with his fists, to seize the lamp, a chair, his
      walking stick; he held his breath; he could have tossed a coin for his
      life; but then, wandering like a little lost breeze among his bitter
      thoughts, came a beginning perception of the anguish in this father's
      heart. It confused him, softened him. His own voice was unsteady as he
      replied: &ldquo;Not in the sense you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what sense, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey broke away. Doane moved heavily after him, but stopped short when
      the slighter man dropped wearily into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going to attack you,&rdquo; said Brachey, &ldquo;but for God's sake sit
      down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you mean by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simply this.&rdquo; Brachey's head dropped on his hand; he stared at the floor
      of rough tiles. &ldquo;I love her. She knows it. She even seems to return it. I
      have roused deep feelings in her. Perhaps in doing that I have harmed her.
      I can't say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all? You are telling me everything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane walked across the room; came back; looked down at Brachey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know how such men as you are regarded, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.... Oh, perhaps!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will leave T'ainan, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no question about that. You will leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's one question&mdash;a man dislikes to leave the woman he loves in
      actual danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An expression of bewilderment passed across Duane's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You admit that you are married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you speak as my daughter's lover. Does the fact of your marriage mean
      nothing to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are planning to fall back on the divorce court, perhaps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Brachey's head came up then. &ldquo;Does love mean nothing to you?&rdquo; he
      cried. &ldquo;In your narrow, hard missionary heart is there no sympathy for the
      emotions that seize on a man and a woman and break their wills and shake
      them into submission?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Looking up, he saw the color surge into Doane's face. Anger rose there
      again. The man seemed desperate, bitter. There was no way, apparently, to
      handle him; he was a new sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane crossed the room again; came back to the middle. He seemed to be
      biting his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have no more words from you,&rdquo; he suddenly cried out. &ldquo;You'll go in
      the morning! I'll have to take your word that you won't communicate with
      Betty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my God, I can't just save myself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may not be so safe for you or any of us. Will you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh... yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not try to see Betty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey sprang up; leaned against the table; pushed the lamp away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I know what I shall do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You will do as I say. You are never to communicate with her again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey thought. &ldquo;I'll say this: I'll undertake not to. If I can't endure
      it, I'll tell you first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can endure it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don't understand! It's a terrible thing! Do you think I wanted to
      come out here? I meant not to. But I couldn't stand it. I came. Is it
      nothing that I told her of my marriage with the deliberate purpose of
      frightening her away? But she is afraid of nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;she is not afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, I've been torn all to pieces. Good God, if I hadn't been, and
      if you weren't her father, do you think I'd have stood here to-night and
      let you say these things to me! Oh, you would beat me; likely enough you'd
      kill me; but that's nothing. That would be easy&mdash;except for Betty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no time for heroics,&rdquo; said Doane. &ldquo;Have I your promise that you
      will leave in the morning, without a word to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to Hung Chan. There are more important issues now than your
      life or mine. I shall be back to-morrow night and shall know then if you
      have failed to keep your word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan't fail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well! A word more. You are not to stop at Ping Yang on your way
      cut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a night only. Then go on. Go out of the province. Go back to the
      coast. Is that understood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey inclined his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have your promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Good night, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane turned to the door. But then he hesitated, turned, hesitated again,
      finally came straight over and thrust out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey, to his own amazement, took it.

      CHAPTER XIV&mdash;DILEMMA

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN DOANE had gone
      Brachey called John and ordered a mule litter for eight n the morning.
      John found ont of the soldiers among the lounging group by the gate. The
      soldier slipped out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey busied himself until midnight in packing his bags. He felt that he
      couldn't sleep; most of the later night was spent in alternately walking
      the floor and trying to read. Before dawn the lamp burned out; and he lay
      down in his clothes and for a few hours dreamed wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight the spike-studded gates swung open and an Oriental cavalcade
      filed into the court. There was the litter, like a sedan chair but much
      larger, swung on poles between two mules; the sides covered with red
      cloth, the small swinging doors in blue; bells jingling about the necks of
      the mules. There were five or six other mules and asses, each hearing a
      wooden pack-saddle. There was a shaggy Manchurian pony for Brachey to ride
      in clear weather. Three muleteers, two men and a boy, marched beside the
      animals; hardy ragged fellows, already, or perhaps always, caked with
      dirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      At once the usual confusion and noise began. Men of the inn crowded about
      to help pack the boxes and bags of food and water and clothing on the
      saddles. The mules plunged and kicked. A rope broke and had to be
      elaborately repaired. The four soldiers brought out their white ponies,
      saddled them, slung their carbines over their shoulders; they were
      handsome men, not so ragged, in faded blue uniforms of baggy Chinese cut,
      blue half-leggings, blue turbans. Into the litter went Brachey's mattress
      and pillow. He tossed in after them camera, note-book, and <i>The Bible in
      Spain;</i> then mounted his savage little pony, which for a moment plunged
      about among the pack animals, starting the confusion anew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cook mounted one of the pack-saddles, perching himself high on a bale,
      his feet on the neck of the mule. John was about to mount another, when
      the leading soldier handed him a letter which he brought at once to his
      master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey with bounding pulse looked at the envelope. But the address,
      &ldquo;Mister J. Brachey, Esquire,&rdquo; was not in Betty's brisk little hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tore it open, and read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Dear Sir&mdash;Taking Time touch and go by the forelock it becomes
      privileged duty to advise you to wit:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So-called Lookers and Western soldiers of that ilk have attacked mission
      college Hung Chan with crop up outcome that these unpleasant fellow's go
      the limit in violence. By telegraph officer of devotion to His Excellency
      this morning very early passes the tip that that mission college stands
      longer not a whit upon earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looker soldiers acting under thumb of man mentioned during our little
      chin-chin of yesterday forenoon plan within twenty-four hours advance on
      T'ain-an-fu cutting off city from Eastern access and then resting on oars,
      jolly well taking their time to destroy mission here and secondary
      Christians, making clean job of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Officer of devotion reports further of old reprobate plan that larger
      army has become nearly ready to march full tilt and devil take the
      hindmost on Ping Yang engineer compound fort and lay axe to root of it.
      Railroad and bridges and all works of white hands will go way of wrack and
      ruin except telegraph, that being offspring of Imperial Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, my dear sir, as Ping Yang is place of some strength and come on
      if you dare, I would respectfully recommend that you engage at once in
      forlorn hope and make journey post haste to Ping Yang, as we sit on kegs
      of gun powder with ground slipping out from under us as hour-glass runs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Regretting in great heaviness and sadness of heart that civilization sees
      no longer light of day in Hansi Province, I beg to remain, my Dear Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours most respectfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Po Sui-an.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P. S. In my busy as bee excitement I have neglected to kill two birds
      with one stone, and inform you that Rev. Doane of this city met death
      bravely at 3 a.m. to-day at Hung Chan Northern Gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Po.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cavalcade was ready now in line. At the head two soldiers sat their
      ponies. The gay litter came next, bells jingling as the mules stirred.
      Behind the litter stood the pack animals, with John and the cook mounted
      precariously on the first two. The other two soldiers brought up the rear.
      The muleteers stood lazily by, waiting.... Brachey slipped Mr. Po's letter
      into a pocket and gazed up at the smoke that curled lazily from the
      chimney of the innkeeper's house. The pony, restless to be off, plunged a
      little; Brachey quieted him without so much as looking down.... After a
      brief time he lowered his eyes. A little girl with normal feet was
      trudging round and round the millstones, laboriously grinding out a double
      handful of flour; a skinny old woman, in trousers, her feet mere stumps,
      hobbled across the court with a stew pan, not so much as looking up at the
      caravan or at the haughty white stranger; ragged men moved about among the
      animals behind the manger. The huge gates had been swung open by coolies,
      who stood against them; outside was the narrow, deep-rutted roadway, with
      shops beyond.... Finally, brows knit as if he were at once hurt and
      puzzled, face white, Brachey took in the caravan&mdash;the calmly waiting
      soldiers, the muleteers, the grotesquely mounted cook and interpreter, the
      large, boxlike vehicle suspended in its richly dingy colors between two
      mules&mdash;and then, with tightly compressed lips and a settling frown,
      he rode out into the street ahead of the soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a lively jingle of bells and creakings from the litter as it swayed
      into motion, the others followed. One of the soldiers promptly came up
      alongside Brachey; their two ponies nearly filled the street, crowding
      passers-by into doorways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey led the way out through the Northern Gate to the mission compound.
      Here he dismounted, handed his reins to a muleteer, and entered the gate
      house.

      hurried from his chair and barred the inner door. Regarding this white man
      he had orders from Mrs. Boatwright. Brachey, however, brushed him
      carelessly aside and went on into the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the sort of thing, this walking coolly in, where he was not wanted,
      that he did well. He really cared nothing what they thought. He distrusted
      profoundly Mrs. Boatwright's judgment, and did not even consider sending
      in his name or a note. The hour had come for meeting her face to fare and
      by force of will defeating her. There was no time now for indulgence in
      personal eccentricities on the part of any of these few white persons set
      off in a vast, threatening world of yellow folk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the spacious courtyard the sunlight lay in glowing patches on the
      red tile. Through open windows came the fresh school-room voices of girls.
      At the steps of a small building at his right stood or lounged a group of
      Chinese men and old women and children&mdash;Brachey had learned that only
      by occasional chance is a personable young or even middle-aged.
    </p>
    <p>
      He led the way out through the northern gate aged woman visible to
      masculine eyes in China&mdash;each apparently with some ailment; one man
      had eczema; one boy a goitre that puffed out upon his breast, others with
      traces of the diseases that rage over China unchecked except to a tiny
      degree here and there in the immediate neighborhood of a medical
      mission.... It was a scene of peace and apparent security. The mission
      organization was functioning normally. Clearly they hadn't the news.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thin thoughtful woman came out of a school building, and confronted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Mr. Brachey,&rdquo; said he coldly; &ldquo;Jonathan Brachey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman drew herself up stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I do for you, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was stern; hostile.... How little it mattered!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must see you all together, at once,&rdquo; he said in the same coldly direct
      manner&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Boatwright, if you please, and any others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you say what you have to say to me now? I am Miss Hemphill, the
      head teacher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, not a muscle of his face relaxing. &ldquo;May I ask why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not a matter of individual judgment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mrs. Boatwright will refuse to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sony, but Mrs. Boatwright will have to see me and at once. And not
      alone, if you please. I don't care to allow her to dismiss what I have to
      say without consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hemphill considered; finally went up into the dispensary, past the
      waiting unfortunates on the steps. Brachev stood erect, motionless, like a
      military man. After a moment, Miss Hemphill came out, followed by another
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Dr. Cassin,&rdquo; she said; adding with a slight hesitation as if she
      found the word unpalatable&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Brachey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The physician at once took the matter in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will please tell us what you have to say, Mr. Brachey. It will be
      better not to trouble Mrs. Boatwright.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey made no reply to this speech; merely stood as if thinking the
      matter over. Then his eye caught' a glimpse of something pink and white
      that fluttered past an up-stairs window. Then, still without a word, he
      went on to the residence, mounted the steps and rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two women promptly followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will please not enter this house,&rdquo; said Dr. Cassin severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Chinese servant opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to see Mr. and Mrs. Boatwright at once,&rdquo; said Brachey; then, as
      the servant was about to close the door, stepped within.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two women pressed in after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are acting in a very high-handed manner,&rdquo; remarked Dr. Cassin with
      heat&mdash;&ldquo;an insolent manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret that it is necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is <i>not</i> necessary!&rdquo; This from Miss Hemphill.
    </p>
    <p>
      He merely looked at her, then away; stood waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boatwright appeared in a doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; was all she seemed able to say at the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you kindly send for the others&rdquo;&mdash;thus Brachey&mdash;&ldquo;Mr.
      Boatwright, any other whites who may be here, and&mdash;Miss Doane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not. Why are you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not a matter for you to decide. I must have everybody present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a rustle from the stairs. Betty, very pale, her slim young
      person clad in a lacy négligée gown of Japanese workmanship, very quick
      and light and nervously alert, came down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you please go back to your room?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Boatwright.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the girl, coming on as far as the newel post, stopped there and
      replied, regretfully, even gently, but firmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mrs. Boatwright.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you at least do us the courtesy to dress yourself properly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, Betty, her eyes straining anxiously toward Brachey, ignored.
    </p>
    <h3>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>r. Casein then
      abruptly, speaking in Chinese, sent the servant for Mr. Boatwright, and
      deliberately led the way into the front room. The others followed, without
      a word, and stood about silently until the appearance of Mr. Boatwright,
      who came in rather breathless, mopping his small features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; he said to Brachey; and for an instant seemed to be
      considering extending his hand; but after a brief survey of the grimly
      silent figures in the room, catching the general depression in the social
      atmosphere, he let the hand fall by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Braehey,&rdquo; remarked Dr. Cassin, with an air of professional
      briskness, &ldquo;every one is present. We are ready for the business that
      brought you here.&rdquo; Brachey looked about the room; his eyes rested longest
      on the physician. To her he handed the letter, saying simply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was written within the hour, by Po Sui-an, secretary to His
      Excellency Pao Ting Chuan. Will you please read it aloud, Dr. Cassin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as if through with the others, he went straight over to Betty, who
      stood by the windows. Quickly and softly he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brace up, little girl! It is bad news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;is it&mdash;is it&mdash;father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed. She saw his tightened lips and the shine in his eyes; then she
      wavered, fought for breath, caught at his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boatwright was calling out, apparently to Betty, something about
      taking a chair on the farther side of the room. There was a stir of
      confusion; but above it Brachey's voice rose sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read, please, Dr. Cassin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soberly they listened. After beginning the postscript, Dr. Cassin stopped
      short; then, slowly, with considerable effort, read the announcement of
      Griggsby Duane's death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the room was still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boatwright was the first to speak; gently for her, and unsteadily,
      though the strong will that never failed this vigorous woman carried her
      along without a sign of hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; she said, addressing Miss Hemphill, &ldquo;you had better go up-stairs
      with Betty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Cassin, ignoring this, or perhaps only half-hearing it (her eyes were
      brimming) broke in with:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Brachey, you must have come here with some definite plan or purpose.
      Will you please tell us what it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Boatwright&mdash;&ldquo;no! If you please, Mary, this man must
      not stay here. Betty!... Betty, dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty did not even turn. She was staring out the window into the peaceful
      sunflecked courtyard, the tears running unheeded down her cheeks, her hand
      twisted tightly in Brachey's. He spoke now, in the cold voice, very stiff
      and constrained, that masked his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The death of Mr. Doane makes it clear that there is no safety here. There
      is a chance, to-day, for us all to get safely away. I have, at the gate, a
      litter and one riding horse, also a few pack animals. Most of my goods can
      be thrown aside&mdash;clothing, all that. The food I have, used sparingly,
      would serve for a number of us. We should be able to pick up a few carts.
      I suggest that we do so at once, and that we get away within an hour, if
      possible. We must keep together, of course. I suggest further, that any
      differences between us be set aside for the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked at one another. Miss Hemphill pursed her lips and knit her
      brows, as if unable to think with the speed required. Dr. Cassin, sad of
      face, soberly thinking, moved absently over to the silent girl by the
      window; gently put an arm about her shoulders. Mr. Boatwright, sunk deeply
      in his chair, was pulling with limp aimless fingers at the fringe on the
      chair-arm; once he glanced up at his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This may not be true,&rdquo; said Mrs. Boatwright abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is from Pao's yamen,&rdquo; said Miss Hemphill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it may be no more than a rumor. Our first duty is to telegraph Mrs.
      Nacy at Hung Chan and ask for full particulars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&rdquo;&mdash;this was Mr. Boatwright; he cleared his throat&mdash;&ldquo;is there
      time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boatwright's mouth had clamped shut. No one had ever succeeded in
      stampeding or even hurrying her mind. She had, for the moment, dismissed
      the special problem of Betty and this man Brachey from that mind and was
      considering the general problem. That settled, she would again take up the
      Brachey matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is time,&rdquo; she said, after a moment. &ldquo;There must be. Mr. Doane left
      positive instructions that we were to await his return. He will be here
      to-night or to-morrow morning, if he is alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;my dear&rdquo;&mdash;it was her husband again&mdash;&ldquo;Po is careful to
      explain that by to-morrow escape will be cut off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; replied his wife, still intently thinking, &ldquo;is only a rumor, after
      all. China is always full of rumors. Even if it is true, these soldiers
      are not likely to act so promptly, whatever Po may think. If they should,
      we shall be no safer on the highway than here in our own compound.... And
      how about our natives? How about our girls&mdash;all of them? Shall we
      leave them?... No!&rdquo; She was thinking, tanking. &ldquo;No, I shall not go. I am
      going to stay here. I shall keep my word to Mr. Doane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she rose and approached the little group by the window. Her eyes,
      resting on the firmly clasped hands of the lovers, snapped fire. Her face,
      again, was granite. To Dr. Cassiri, very quietly, she remarked, &ldquo;Take
      Betty up-stairs, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The physician, obeying, made a gentle effort to draw the girl away; but
      met with no success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boatwright addressed herself to Brachey: &ldquo;Will you please leave this
      compound at once!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said nothing. Betty's fingers were twisting within his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can hardly make use of force,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Boatwright, &ldquo;but I ask
      you to leave us. And we do not wish to see you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey drew in a slow long breath: looked about the room, from one to
      another. Miss Hemphill and Boatwright had risen; both were watching him;
      the little man seemed to have found his courage, for his chin was up now.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Brachey felt, knew, that they were a unit against him. The
      fellow-feeling, the community of faith and habit that had drawn them
      together through long, lonely years of service, was stronger now than any
      mere threat of danger, even of death. They felt with the indomitable woman
      who had grown into the leadership, and would stay with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey surveyed them. These were the missionaries he had despised as
      weak, narrow little souls. Narrow they might be, but hardly weak. No, not
      weak. Even this curious little Boatwright; something that looked like
      strength had come to life in him. He wouldn't desert. He would stay. To
      certain and horrible death, apparently. The very certainty of the danger
      seemed to be clearing that wavering little mind of his. A thought that
      made it all the more puzzling was that these people knew, so much better,
      so much more deeply, than he, all that had happened in 1900. Their own
      friends and pupils&mdash;white and yellow&mdash;had been slaughtered. The
      heart-breaking task of reconstruction had been theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at the same time, seeming like a thought-strand in his brain, was the
      heart-breaking pressure of that soft, honest little hand in his.... Very
      likely it was the end for all of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he said icily. &ldquo;I am sorry I can't be of use. However, if any
      of you care to go I shall esteem it a privilege to share my caravan with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one spoke, or moved. The iron face of Mrs. Boatwright confronted his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very gently, fighting his deepest desire, fighting, it seemed, life
      itself, he tried to disentangle his fingers from Betty's.
    </p>
    <p>
      But hers gripped the more tightly. There was a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Betty whispered&mdash;faintly, yet not caring who might hear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't let you go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I can't stay here. Will you take me with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He found this impossible to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won't take me long. Just a few things in a bag.&rdquo; And she started away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boatwright made an effort to block her, but Betty, without another
      sound, slipped by and out of the room and ran up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mrs. Boatwright turned on the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will do this?&rdquo; she said, in firm stinging tunes. &ldquo;You will take this
      girl away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her out of an expressionless face. Behind that mask, his mind
      was swiftly surveying the situation from every angle. He knew that he
      couldn't, as it stood, leave Betty here. And they wouldn't let him stay.
      He must at least try to save her. Nothing else mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boatwright turned away. Brachey moved out into the hall and stood
      there. To her &ldquo;At least you will step outside this house?&rdquo; he replied,
      simply, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Dr. Cassin, with a remark about the waiting queue at the
      dispensary, went quietly back to her routine work, as if there were no
      danger in the world. Mr Boatwright had turned to his wife's desk, and was
      making a show of looking over some papers there. Miss Hemphill sank into a
      chair and stared at the wall with the memory of horror in her eyes. Mrs.
      Boatwright stood within the doorway, waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little time passed. Then Betty came running down the stairs, in
      traveling suit, carrying a hand-bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boatwright stepped forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You really mean to tell me that you will go&mdash;alone&mdash;with this
      man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty's lips slowlyy formed the word, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then never come again to me. I can not help you. You are simply bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty turned to Brachey; gave him her bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the gate house the little caravan waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mules were brought to their knees. Betty stepped, without a word, into
      the litter. Brachey closed the side door, and mounted his pony. The mules
      were kicked and flogged to their feet. The two soldiers in the lead set
      off around the city wall to the corner by the eastern gate, whence the
      main highway mounted slowly into the hills toward Ping Yang. As they
      turned eastward, a fourth muleteer, ragged and dirty, bearing a small
      pack, as the others, joined the party; a fact not observed by the white
      man, who rode close beside the litter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when they had passed the last houses and were out where the road began
      to sink below the terraced grain-fields, the new muleteer stepped forward.
      For a little space he walked beside the white man's pony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey, at last aware of him, glanced down at the ragged figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a deuce of a note,&rdquo; said the new muleteer, looking up and smiling,
      &ldquo;that your courtesy should return like confounded boomerang on your head.
      I make thousands of apologies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey started; then said, merely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!... You!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I have in my own canoe take French leave. That it is funny as the
      devil and intruding presumption I know full well. But I have thought to be
      of service and pay my shot if you offer second helping of courtesy and
      glad hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey nodded. &ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; said he.

      CHAPTER XV&mdash;THE HILLS
    </h2>
    <h3>

    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>OST of the day,
      advised by Brachey. Betty kept closed the swinging litter doors. The
      little caravan settled into the routine of the highway, the muleteers
      trudging beside their animals. The gait was a steady three miles an hour.
      John rode his pack-saddle hour after hour, until six' o'clock in the
      evening, without a word. Just behind him, the cook, a thin young man with
      dreamy eyes, sang quietly a continuous narrative in a wailing, yodling
      minor key.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the end of the first hour they had lost sight of T'ainan-fu and
      buried themselves in the hills; buried themselves in a double sense, for
      wherever water runs in Northwestern China the roads are narrow canyons. At
      times, however, the way mounted high along the hillsides, on narrow
      footways of which the mules all instinctively trod the outer edge. Brachey
      found it alarming to watch the litter as it swayed over some nearly
      perpendicular precipice. For neither up here on the hillsides nor along
      the path nor in the depths below was there a sign of solid rock; it was
      all the red-brown earth known as loess, which is so fine that it may be
      ribbed into the pores like talc or flour and that packs down as firmly as
      chalk. Along the sunken ways were frequent caves, the dwelling-places of
      crippled, loathsome beggars, with rooms cut out square and symmetrical
      doors and windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the high places one might look across a narrow chasm and see,
      decorating the opposite wall, strata of the loess in delicately varied
      tints of brown, red, Indian red and crimson, with blurred soft streaks of
      buff and yellow at times marking the divisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hills themselves were steep and crowded in, as if a careless Oriental
      deity had scooped together great handfuls of brown dice and thrown them
      haphazard into heaps. Trees were so few&mdash;here and there one might be
      seen clinging desperately to a terrace-wall where the narrow fields of
      sprouting millet and early shoots of vegetables mounted tier on tier to
      the very summits of the hills&mdash;that the general effect was of utter
      barrenness, a tumbling red desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much cf the time they were winding through the canyons or twisting about
      the hillsides with only an occasional outlook wider than a few hundred
      yards or perhaps a half-mile, but at intervals the crowded little peaks
      would separate, giving them a sweeping view over miles of shadowy red
      valleys.... At such times Betty would open one of her windows a little and
      lean forward; riding close behind, Brachey could see her face, usually so
      brightly alert, now sad, peeping out at the richly colored scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frequently they passed trains of camels or asses or carts, often on a
      precipice where one caravan hugged the loess wall while the other flirted
      with death along the earthen edge. But though the Hansean or Chihlean
      muleteers shouted and screamed in an exciting confusion of voices and the
      Mongol camel drivers growled and the ponies plunged, no animal or man was
      lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly always the air was heavy with fine red dust. It enveloped them like
      a fog, penetrating clothing, finding its way into packs and hand-bags. At
      times it softened and exquisitely tinted the view.
    </p>
    <p>
      At long intervals the little caravan wound its slow way through villages
      that were usually built along a single narrow street. In the broader
      valleys the villages, gray brown and faintly red like the soil of which
      their bricks had once been moulded, clung compactly to hill-slopes safely
      above the torrents of spring and autumn, each little settlement with its
      brick or stone wall and its ornamental pagoda gates, and each with its
      cluster of trees about some consequential tomb rising above the low roofs
      in plumes of pale green April foliage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nowhere was there a sign of the disorder that was ravaging the province
      like a virulent disease. Brachey was aware of no glances of more than the
      usual passing curiosity from slanting eyes. He saw only the traditional
      peaceful countryside of the Chinese interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sense of peace and calm had an effect on his moody self that
      increased as the day wore on. Life was turning unreal on his hands. His
      judgment wavered and played tricks with memory. Had it been so dangerous
      back there in T'ainan? Could it have been? He had to look steadily at the
      ragged, trudging figure of the erstwhile elegant Mr. Po to recapture a
      small degree of mental balance.... He had brought Betty away. He saw this
      now with a nervous, vivid clarity for what it was, an irrevocable act. It
      had come about naturally and simply; it had felt inevitable; yet now at
      moments, unable to visualize again the danger that had seemed terribly
      real in T'ainan he felt it only as the logical end of the emotional drift
      that had carried the two of them far out beyond the confines of reason. It
      was even possible that Mrs. Boatwright's judgment was the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Betty couldn't go back now; they had turned her off; not unless her
      father should yet prove to be alive, and that was hardly thinkable.
      Anxiously during the day, he asked Mr. Po about that. But Mr. Po's
      confidence in the accuracy of his information was unshakable. So here he
      was, with a life on his hands, a life so dear to him that he could not
      control his mind in merely thinking of her there in the litter, traveling
      along without a question, for better or worse, with himself; a life that
      perhaps, despite this new spirit of consecration that was rising in his
      breast, he might succeed only in injuring. Brooding thus, he became grave
      and remote from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his distant way he was very considerate, very kind. During the
      afternoon, as they moved up a long valley, skirting a broad watercourse
      where peach and pear trees foamed with blossoms against the lower slopes
      of the opposite hills, he persuaded her to descend from the litter and
      walk for a mile or two with him. He felt then her struggle to keep
      cheerful and make conversation, but himself lacked the experience with
      women that would have made it possible for him to overcome his own
      depression and brighten her, Once, when the caravan stopped to repack a
      slipping saddle, he asked her to sketch the view for him. It was his idea
      that she should be kept occupied when possible. He always corrected his
      own moods in that disciplinary manner. But just then his feelings were
      running so high, his tenderness toward her was so sensitively deep, that
      he spoke bruskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rode on through the sunset into the dusk. The red hills turned slowly
      purple under the glowing western sky, swam mistily in a world-wide sea of
      soft dame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty opened her windows wide now; gazed out at this scene of unearthly
      beauty with a sad deep light in her eyes.
    </p>
    <h3>

    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hey rode into
      another village. A soldier galloped on ahead to inspect the less
      objectionable inn. He reappeared soon, and the caravan jingled and creaked
      into a courtyard and stopped for the night. John dismounted and plunged
      into argument with the innkeeper. The cook set to work removing a
      pack-saddle. Coolies appeared. The mules were beaten to their knees.
      Brachey threw his bridle to a soldier and helped Betty out of the litter.
      Then they stood, he and she, amid the confusion, her hand resting lightly
      on his arm, her eyes on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here they were! He felt now her loneliness, her sadness, her&mdash;the
      word rose&mdash;her helpless dependence upon himself. She was so helpless!
      His heart throbbed with feeling. He couldn't look down at her, standing
      there so close. He couldn't have spoken; not just then. He was struggling
      with the impractical thought that he might yet protect her from the savage
      tongues of the coast; from himself, even, when you came to it. The
      depression that had been pulling him down all day was turning now, rushing
      up and flooding his fired brain like a bitter tide. He shouldn't have let
      her come. It had been a beautiful impulse; her quiet determination to give
      her life into his hands had thrilled him beyond his deepest dreams of
      happiness, had lifted him to a plane of devotion that he remembered now,
      felt again, even in his bitterness, as utter beauty, intensified rather
      than darkened by the tragic quality of the hour. But he shouldn't have let
      her come. Mightn't she, after all, have been as safe hack there in the
      mission compound? What was the matter?... He hadn't thought of her coming
      on with him alone. That had simply happened. It was bewildering. Life had
      swept them out of commonplace safety, and now here they were! And nothing
      to do but go on, go through!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I left my bag in there,&rdquo; he heard her saying, and himself got it
      quickly from the litter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then John came. The &ldquo;number one&rdquo; rooms were to be theirs, it seemed;
      Betty's and his.... If only he could talk to her! She needed him so !
      Never, perhaps, again, would she need him as now, and he, it seemed, was
      failing her. Silently he led her up the steps of the little building at
      the end of the courtyard and into the corridor; peered into one dim room
      and then into the other; then curtly, roughly ordered John to spread for
      her his own square of new matting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hand was still on his arm, resting there, oh, so lightly. She seemed
      very slim and small.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a dreadful place,&rdquo; he made himself say. &ldquo;But we'll have to make the
      best of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mind,&rdquo; he thought she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps we'd better have dinner in here, It's a little cleaner than my
      room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced up at him, then down: &ldquo;I don't believe I can eat anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I'll try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll ask Mr. Po to come in with us. He is a gentleman. And perhaps it
      would be better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's John with hot water. I'll leave you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll&mdash;come back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For dinner, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this he gently withdrew his arm. As she watched him go her eyes
      filled Then she closed her door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey found Mr. Po curled on the ground against a pack-saddle, smoking a
      Chinese pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose at once, all smiles, and bowed half-way to the ground. But he
      thought it inadvisable to accept the invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate to be fly in ointments,&rdquo; he said, with his curiously dispassionate
      quickness and ease of speech, &ldquo;but it's really no go. Our own men would
      play game of thick and thin blood brother, but to village gossip monger I
      must remain muleteer and down and out person of no account. It's a dam'
      sight safer for each and every one of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>

    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>etty tried to set
      the dingy room to rights. John had laid a white cloth over the table, and
      put out Brachey's tin plate and cup, his knife, fork and spoon, an English
      biscuit tin and a bright little porcelain jar of Scotch jam that was
      decorated with a red-and-green plaid. These things helped a little. She
      tidied herself as best she could; and then waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time she sat by the table, very still, hands folded in her lap; but
      this was difficult, for thoughts came&mdash;thoughts that spun around and
      around and bewildered her&mdash;and tears. The tears she would not permit.
      She got up; rearranged the things on the table; moved over to the window,
      and through a hole in one of the paper squares watched with half-seeing
      eyes the coolies and soldiers and animals in the courtyard. Her head
      ached. And that wheel of patchwork thoughts spun uncontrollably around.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a little time then the tears came unhindered. That her father, that
      strong splendid man, could have been casually slain by vagabonds in a
      Chinese city seemed now, as it had seemed all day, incredible. His loss
      was only in part personal to her, so much of her life had been lived on
      the other side of the world; but childhood memories of him rose, and
      pictures of him as she had lately seen him, grave and kind and (since that
      moving little talk about beauty and its importance in the struggle of
      life) lovable. Her mother, too, had to-day become again a vivid memory.
      And then the sheer mystery of death twisted and tortured her sensitive
      Pagination, led her thoughts out into regions so grimly, darkly beautiful,
      so unbearably poignant, that her slender frame shook with sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sensation of rootlessness, too, was upon her. But now it was complete.
      There was no tie to hold her to life. Only this man on whom, moved by
      sheer emotion, without a thought of self, yet (she thought now) with utter
      unreasoning selfishness, she had fastened herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boatwright had called her bad. That couldn't be true. She couldn't
      picture herself as that. Even now, in this bitter crisis, she wasn't hard,
      wasn't even reckless; simply bewildered and terribly alone. Emotion had
      caught her. It <i>was</i> like a net. It had carried her finally out of
      herself. There was no way back; she was caught. Yet now the only thing
      that had justified this step&mdash;and how simple, how easy it had
      appeared in the morning!&mdash;the beautiful sober passion that had drawn
      her to the one mate, was clouded. For he had changed! He had drawn away.
      They were talking no more of love. She couldn't reach him; her desperately
      seeking heart groped in a dim wilderness and found no one, nothing. His
      formal kindness hurt her. Nothing could help her but love; and love,
      perhaps, was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the wheel spun on and on.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw him talking with the indomitably courteous Mr. Po. He came back
      then to the building they were to share that night. She heard him working
      at his door across the narrow corridor, trying to close it. He succeeded;
      then stirred about his room for a long time; a very long time, she
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then John came across the court from the innkeeper's kitchen with covered
      dishes, steaming hot. She let him in; then, while he was setting out the
      meal, turned away and once more fought back the tears. Brachey must not
      see them. She was helped in this by a sudden mentally blinding excitement
      that came, an inexplicable nervous tension. He was coming; and alone, for
      she had seen Mr. Po shake his head and settle back contentedly with his
      pipe against the pack-saddle.... That was the strange fact about love; it
      kept rushing unexpectedly back whenever her unstable reason had for a
      little while disposed of it; an unexpected glimpse of him, a bit of his
      handwriting, a mere thought was often enough. Sorrow could not check it;
      at this moment her heart seemed broken by the weight of the tragic world,
      yet it thrilled at the sound of his step. And it couldn't be wholly
      selfish, for the quite overwhelming uprush of emotion brought with it a
      deeper tenderness toward her brave father, toward that pretty, happy
      mother of the long ago; she thought even of her school friends. She was
      suddenly stirred with the desire to face this strange struggle called
      living and conquer it. Her heart leaped. He was coming!
    </p>
    <p>
      His door opened. He stepped across the corridor and tapped at hers. She
      hurried to open it. All impulse, she reached out a hand; then, chilled,
      caught again in the dishearteringly formal mood of the day, drew it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      For he stood stiffly there, clad in black with smooth white shirt-front
      and collar and little black tie. He had dressed for dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned quickly toward the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John has everything ready,&rdquo; she said, now quite as formal as he. &ldquo;We may
      as well sit right down.&rdquo;
     </p>

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>or a time they
      barely spoke. John had lighted the native lamp, and it flickered gloomily
      in the swiftly gathering darkness, throwing a huge shadow of him on the
      walls, and even on the ceiling, as he moved softly in his padded shoes
      about the table and in and out at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty's mood had sunk, now at last, into the unreal. She seemed to be
      living through a dream of nightmare quality&mdash;something she had&mdash;it
      was elusive, haunting&mdash;lived through before. She saw Jonathan Brachey
      distantly, as she had seen him at first, so bewilderingly long ago on a
      ship in the Inland Sea of Japan. She saw again his long bony nose, coldly
      reflective eyes, firmly modeled head.... And he was talking, when he spoke
      at all, as he had talked on the occasion of their first meeting, slowly,
      in somewhat stilted language, pausing interminably while he hunted about
      in his amazing mind for the word or phrase that would precisely express
      his meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a village a short distance this side of Ping Yang, Mr. Po tells
      me&rdquo;... here a pause... &ldquo;not an important place. Ordinarily we should pass
      through it about noon of the day after to-morrow. But he has picked up
      word that a Looker band has been organized there, and he thinks it may be
      best for us to...&rdquo; and here a pause so long as to become nearly unbearable
      to Betty. For a time she moved her fork idly about her plate, waiting for
      that next word. At length she gave up, folded her hands in her lap, tried
      to compose her nerves. After that she glanced timidly at him, then looked
      up at the waveing shadows on the dim veils. It was almost as if he had
      forgotten she was there. He was interested, apparently, in nothing in life
      except those words he sought: &ldquo;... to make a detour to the south.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty drew in a deep breath. She felt her color coming slowly back. The
      'best thing to do, she decided, was to go on trying to eat. He had been
      right enough about that. She must try. It was, in a way, her part of it;
      to keep strong. Or she would be more hopelessly than ever fastened on
      him.... It seemed to her as never before a dreadful thing to be a woman.
      Tears came again, and she fought them back, even managed actually to eat a
      little. &ldquo;It will mean still another....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another what?&rdquo; She waited and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another night on the road, after tomorrow. I am sorry.&rdquo;

      She had lately forgotten the slightly rasping quality in his voice, though
      it had been what she had first heard there. Now it seemed to her that she
      could hear nothing else.... What blind force was it that had thrust them
      so wide apart; after those ardent, tender, heart-breaking hours together
      at T'ainan; wonderful stolen hours, stirring her to a happiness so wildly
      beautiful that it touched creative springs in her sensitive young soul and
      released the strong eager woman there. This, the present situation,
      carried her so far beyond her experience, beyond her mental grasp, that,
      she could only sit very quiet and try to weather it. She could do that, of
      course, somehow. One did. It came down simply to the gift of character.
      And that, however undeveloped, she had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then, of course, clear thoughts flashed out for a moment; but only
      for a moment at a time. She sensed clearly enough that his whole being was
      centered on the need of protecting her. It was the fineness in him that
      made him hold himself so rigidly to the task. But it was a task to him;
      that was the thing. And his reticence! It was his attitude&mdash;or was it
      hers?&mdash;that had made frank talk impossible all day, ever since their
      moment of perfect silent understanding facing Mrs. Boatwright. He had felt
      then, with her, that she had to come, that it was their only way out; but
      now he, and therefore she, was clouded with afterthoughts. They had come
      to be frank enough about their dilemma, back there at T'ainan. But from
      the moment of leaving the city gate and striking tiff into the hills, they
      had lost something vital. And with every hour of this reticence, this
      talking about nothing, the situation was going to grow worse. She felt
      that, even now; struggled against it; but tound herself moving deeper,
      minute by minute, into the gloom that had settled on them.... And back of
      her groping thoughts, giving them a puzzling sort of life, was excitement,
      energy, the sense of being borne swiftly along on a mighty wave of feeling&mdash;swiftly,
      swiftly, to a tragic, dim place where the withered shadows of youth and
      joy and careless laughter caught at one in hopeless weakness and slipped
      off unheeded into the unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came down at last to politeness. They even spoke of the food; and he
      reproved John for not keeping the curried mutton hot. And then, without
      one personal word, he rose to go. She rose, too, and stood beside her
      chair; she couldn't raise her eyes. She heard his voice saying, coldly she
      thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall leave you now. You must...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waited, holding her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;... you must get what sleep you can. I think we shall have no trouble
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this he stood for a long moment. She couldn't think why. Then he
      went out, softly closing the door after him. Then his door opened, and,
      with some creaking of rusty hinges and scraping on the tiles, closed. And
      then Betty dropped down by the table and let the tears come.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>HE heard little
      more for several hours; merely a muffled stirring about, at long
      intervals, as if he were walking the floor or trying to move a chair very
      quietly. The cot on which she now so restlessly lay was his. She couldn't
      sleep; he might as well have it, but would, of course, refuse.... She
      listened for a long time to the movements of the animals in the stable.
      Much later&mdash;the gong-clanging watchman had passed on his rounds twice
      at fewest; it must have been midnight&mdash;she heard him working very
      softly at his door. He was occupied some little time at this. She lay
      breathless. At length he got it open, and seemed to stand quietly in the
      corridor. Then, after a long silence, he opened as carefully the outer
      door, that had on it, she knew, a spring of bent steel, like a bow. After
      this he was still; standing outside, perhaps, or sitting on the top step.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she indulged herself in the wish that she might ha\e courage
      to call to him; to call him by name; to call him by the name, &ldquo;John,&rdquo; she
      had no more than begun, that last day in the tennis court, timidly to
      utter. Her whole being yearned toward him She asked herself, lying there,
      why honesty should be impossible to a girl. Why shouldn't she call to him?
      She needed him so; not the strange stilted man of the day and evening, but
      the other, deeply tender lover that breathed still, she was almost sure,
      somewhere within the crust that encased him. And they had been honest, he
      and she; that had turned out to be the wonderful fact in their swift
      courtship.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was only a vivid moment. She made no sound. The warm tears lay on
      her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little&mdash;it rose out of a jumble of wild thoughts, and then
      slowly came clear; she must have been dozing lightly&mdash;she heard his
      voice, very low; then another voice, a man's, that ran easily on in a soft
      nervelessness, doubtless the voice of Mr. Po. She thought of making a
      sound, even of lighting the little iron lamp; they must not be left
      thinking her safely asleep; but she did nothing; and the voices faded into
      dreams as a fitful sleep came to her. Nature is merciful to the young.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>uring those
      evening hours, Brachey sat for the most part staring at his wall. Finally,
      at the very edge of despair&mdash;for life, all that night, and the next
      day and the next night, offered Brachey nothing but a blank, black
      precipice over which he and Betty were apparently plunging&mdash;he gave
      up hope of falling asleep in his chair (important though he knew sleep to
      he, in the grisly light of what might yet have to be faced) and went out
      and sat on the steps; still in the grotesquely inappropriate dinner
      costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shape detached itself from the shadows of the stable door and moved
      silently toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey welcomed the opportunity for a little man talk, if only because it
      might, for the time, take his mind in some degree out of the emotional
      whirlpool in which it was helplessly revolving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've heard no more news?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; replied Mr. Po, with his soft little laugh. &ldquo;There is no more
      oil on fire of province discontent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From your letter I gathered that you are not so sure of Pao.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Po did not at once reply to this; seemed to be considering it, gazing
      out on the moonlit courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no longer a case of cat and mouse,&rdquo; Brachey pressed on. &ldquo;Something
      happened last night at the yamen. Am I right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey waited. After a long pause Mr. Po shifted his position, laughed a
      little, then spoke as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In afternoon yesterday old reprobate, Kang, sent to His Excellency letter
      which passed between my hands as secretary. He said that in days like
      these of great sorrow and humiliation agony of China it is best that those
      of responsible care and devotion to her welfare should draw together in
      friendship, and therefore he would in evening make call on His Excellency
      to express friendship and speak of measures that might lay dust of
      misunderstanding and what-not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hmm!&rdquo; Thus Brachey. &ldquo;And what did <i>that</i> mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the devil to pay and all! It was insult of blackest nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't quite see that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. He should not have written in arrogant put-in-your-place way.
      His Excellency most graciously gave orders to prepare ceremonial banquet
      and presents of highest value, but in his calm eye flashed light of battle
      to death. You see, sir, it was thought of Kang to show all T'ainan and
      near-by province who was who, taking bull by horns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hmm! I don't know as I... well, go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In particular His Excellency made prepare great bowl of sweet lotus soup,
      for in past years Kang had great weakness for such soup made by old cook
      of far-away Canton who attach to His Excellency a devil of a while ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so they had the banquet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, and I was privileged to be in midst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. Banquet was of great dignity and courteous good fellowship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't altogether understand the good fellowship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;China custom habit differs no end from Western custom habit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally. Yes. But what was Kang really up to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm driving at that. After banquet all attendant retinue mandarins
      withdraw out of rooms except secretaries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't they go too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, it was felt by Kang that His Excellency might put it all over
      him with knives of armed men. And His Excellency had not forgotten tricky
      thought of Kang in eighteen-ninety-eight in Shantung when he asks
      disagreement but very strong mandarins to banquet and then sends out
      soldiers to remove heads in a wink while mandarins ride out to their homes
      when all good nights are said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that Kang's men beheaded all his dinner guests, because they
      disagreed with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo; Here Mr. Po grew reflective. &ldquo;Kang is very queer old son of a
      gun&mdash;very tall, very thin, very old, with face all lines that come
      down so&rdquo;&mdash;he drew down his smooth young face in excellent mimicry of
      an old man&mdash;&ldquo;and he stoops so, and squints little sharp eyes like
      river rat, so. A mighty smart man, the reprobate! Regular old devil!&rdquo; Mr.
      Po laughed a little. &ldquo;My bosom friend Chih T'ang slipped himself in to me
      and explained in whisper talk that yamen of His Excellency was surrounded
      by Western soldiers of that old Manchu devil. And within yamen, up to
      third gate itself, swarmed a hell of a crowd of Manchu guard of Kang. It
      was no joke, by thunder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say not,&rdquo; observed Brachey dryly. &ldquo;You were going to tell me
      what Kang was really up to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! I will tell that post haste. When all had gone except four&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, Kang, and His Excellency, and two secretaries?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of whom it was my honor to be absurdly small part. Then Kang
      explained with utmost etiquette courtesy to His Excellency that letter had
      but yesterday come to him of most hellish import and very front rank. And
      his secretary handed cool as you please letter to me and I to Kis
      Excellency. It was letter of Prince Tuan to old Kang giving him power to
      have beheaded at once His Excellency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To behead Pao?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! And Kang said in neat speech then that no one could imagine his
      heartsick distress that one in power should wish great headless injury to
      dear old friend of long years and association government. To him he said
      it meant hell to pay. And he asked that His Excellency pass over from own
      hand infamous letter to be destroyed on spot by own hand of himself with
      firm resolve. But His Excellency smiled&mdash;a dam' big man!&mdash;and
      said for letter of Prince Tuan he felt only worshipful respect and
      obedience spirit, and he gave letter to me, and I delivered it to
      secretary of Kang, and secretary of Kang delivered it; to old Manchu
      himself. Then Kang, with own hands tore letter to bits and dropped bits in
      bowl, and his secretary asked me to have servant burn them, but I put on
      courteous look of attention to slightest wish of His Excellency and do not
      hear low word of secretary to old devil. And then Manchu reprobate with
      great courtesy makes farewell ceremony and goes out to his chair and
      altogether it's a hell of a note.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bradley, in his deliberately reflective way, put the curious story
      together in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kang, of course, sent to Peking for that letter.&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was, in a way, fair warning to Pao that the time had come for action
      and that Pao had better not try to meddle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;all of that. When he had gone Pao was sad. For he knew now
      that Kang had on his side heavy hand of Imperial Court at Peking. And
      then, late in night we have word from yamen of Kang and other word from
      observing officers of His Excellency that Western soldiers make attack at
      Hung Chan and that Reverend Doane is killed at city gate. Old Kang express
      great regret consideration and shed tears of many crocodiles, but they
      don't go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Pao found himself powerless to interfere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! And so then I had audience of His Excellency and with permission
      of his mouth sent letter to you. His Excellency formed opinion right off
      the reel that it is not wise to send warning to mission compound, and that
      if I ever send word to you my head would not longer be of much use to me
      in T'ainan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Need they know of it at Kang's yamen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can not be secrets 'n yamen of great mandarin from observation eyes
      of other mandarin. Nothing doing!''
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see. Spying goes on all the time, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! So I say farewell with tears to His Excellency, and in these old
      clothes of great disrepute, I&rdquo;&mdash;he chuckled&mdash;&ldquo;I make my
      skiddoo.&rdquo; From within the rags about his body he drew a soiled roll of
      paper &ldquo;It has occurred to me that at Ping Yang time might roll around
      heavily on your hands and then, if you don't care what fool thing you do,
      you might bring me great honor by reading this silly little thing. It is
      lecture of which I spoke lightly once too often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Absently Brachey took it. &ldquo;But why can't old Kang see,&rdquo; he asked&mdash;&ldquo;and
      Prince Tuan, for that matter&mdash;that if they are to start in again
      slaughtering white people, they will simply be piling up fresh trouble for
      China? Pao, I gather, does see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh. yes, His Excellency sees very far, but now he must sit on fence and
      wait a bit. Kang, like Prince Tuan, is of the old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't the outcome of the Boxer trouble teach these men anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not these men. Old China mind is not same as Western progress mind&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite understand that, but...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Po was slowly shaking his head. &ldquo;No, old China minds dwell in
      different proposition. It is hard to say.&rdquo;
     </p>

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>oward morning,
      before his lamp burned out, Brachey read the lecture to which Mr. Po was
      pinning such great hopes. It seemed rather hopeless. There was humor, of
      course, in the curious arrangement of English words; but this soon wore
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, sitting in the dark, waiting for the first faint glow of dawn, and
      partly as an exercise of will, he pondered the problems clustering about
      the little, hopeful, always aggressive settlements of white in Chinese
      Asia. Mr. Po's phrases came repeatedly to mind. That one&mdash;&ldquo;Old China
      mind dwell in different proposition.&rdquo; Mr. Po was touching there,
      consciously or not, on the heart of the many-tinted race problems which
      this bafflingly complex old world must one day either settle or give up.
      The inertia of a numerous, really civilized and ancient race like the
      Chinese was in itself a mighty force, one of the mightiest in the
      world.... Men like Prince Tuan and this Kang despised the West, of course.
      And with some reason, when you came down to it. For along Legation Street
      the whites dwelt in a confusion of motives. They had exhibited a firm
      purpose only when Legation Street itself was attacked. By no means all the
      stray casualties among the whites in China were avenged by their
      governments. In the present little crisis out here in Hansi, it might be a
      long time&mdash;a very long time indeed&mdash;before the lumbering
      machinery of government could be stirred to act in an unaccustomed
      direction. At the present time there were not enough American troops in
      China to make possible a military expedition to Ping Yang; merely a
      company of marines at the legation. To penetrate so far inland and
      maintain communication an army corps would be needed; troops might even
      have to be assembled and trained in America. It might take a year. And
      first the diplomats would have to investigate; then the State Department
      would have to be brought by heavy and complicated public pressures to the
      point of actually functioning; a sentimental element back home might
      question the facts... Meantime, he hadn't yet so much as got Betty safely
      to Ping Yang.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was &ldquo;hard to say.&rdquo; But he found objective thought helpful. Emotion
      seemed, this night, not unlike a consuming fire. Emotion was, in its
      nature, desire. It led toward destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      He even made himself sleep a little, in a chair; until John knocked, at
      seven. Then he changed from evening dress to knickerbockers. His spirit
      had now sunk so low that he had John serve them separately with breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the caravan was ready he went out to the courtyard and busied himself
      preparing the litter for her. She came out with John, very white, glancing
      at him with a timid question in her eyes. In his stiffest manner he handed
      her into the litter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, accompanied by three soldiers, they swung out on the highway. The
      fourth soldier joined them outside the wall; him Brachey had sent to the
      telegraph station with a message to his Shanghai bankers advising them
      that his address would be in care of M. Pourmont, the Ho Shan Company,
      Ping Yang, Hansi, and further that cablegrams from America were to be
      forwarded immediately by wire.
    </p>
    <h3>
      4
    </h3>
    <p>
      Only at intervals during the forenoon did Betty and Brachey speak; for the
      most part he rode ahead of the litter. The luncheon hour was awkward; the
      dinner hour, when they had settled at their second inn, was even more
      difficult. They sat over their tin plates and cups in gloomy silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally Betty pushed her plate away, and rose; went over to the papered
      window and stared out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey got slowly to his feet; stood by the table. He couldn't raise his
      eyes; he could only study the outline of his plate and move it a little,
      this way and that, and pick up crumbs from the table-cloth. His mind was
      leaden; the sense of unreality that had come to him on the preceding day
      was now at a grotesque climax. He literally could not think. This, he
      felt, was the final severe test of his character, and it exhibited him as
      a failure. He was then, after all, a lone wolf; his instinct had been
      sound at the start, his nature lacked the quality, the warmth and richness
      of feeling, that the man who would claim a woman's love must offer her. He
      could suffer&mdash;the pain that even now, as he stood listless there,
      downcast, heavily fingering a tin plate, was torturing him to the limits
      of his capacity to endure, told him that&mdash; out suffering seemed a
      poor gift to bring the woman he loved. ... And here they were, unable to
      turn back. It was unthinkable; yet it was true. His reason kept thundering
      at his ear the perhaps tragic fact that his spirit was unable to grasp....
      Braehey, during this hour&mdash;with a bitterness so deep as to border on
      despair&mdash;told himself that his lack amounted to abnormality. His case
      seemed quite hopeless. Yet here he was; and here, irrevocably, was she.
      The harm, whatever it might prove to be, and in spite of his sensitive,
      fire conquest of them emotional problem (at such a price, this!) was done.
      And there were no compensations. Here they were, lost, groping helplessly
      toward each other through a dark labyrinth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even when she turned (he heard her, and felt her eyes) he could not look
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he heard her voice; an unsteady voice, very low; and he felt again
      the simple honesty, the naively child-like quality, that had seemed her
      finest gift. It was the artist strain in her, of course. She was not
      ashamed of her feeling, of her tears; there had never been pretense or
      self-consciousness in her. And while she now, at first, uttered merely his
      name&mdash;'"John!&rdquo;&mdash;his inner ear heard her saying again, as she had
      said during their first talk in the tennis court&mdash;&ldquo;I wonder if it is
      like a net.&rdquo;... Yes, she seemed to be saying that again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was speaking; out of a thick throat:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He met this with a sort of mental dishonesty that he found himself unable
      to avoid. &ldquo;Well&mdash;if all goes well, we shall be safe at Ping Yang
      within forty-eight hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mean that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't have come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't leave you there, dear. Not there at T'ainan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn't you who made the decision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I did it. It seemed the thing to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He managed to look up now, but could not knowhow coolly impenetrable he
      appeared to be. &ldquo;It <i>was</i> the thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She slowly shook her head. &ldquo;No... no, I shouldn't have come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't let you say that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's true. Can't we be honest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question stung him. He dropped again into his chair and sat for a
      brief time, thinking, thinking, in that, to her, terribly deliberate way
      of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're right,&rdquo; he finally came out. &ldquo;We've got to be honest. It's the
      only thing left to us, apparently... The mistake lay back there in
      T'ainan. Our first talk in the tennis court. I knew then that the thing
      for me to do was to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't let you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I should have. That situation was the same as this, only then we
      hadn't crossed our Rubicon. Now w e have. Don't you see? This situation
      has followed that, inevitably. And now we no longer have the power to
      choose. We've got to go on, at least as far as Ping Yang. But we mustn't
      be together...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at him, then away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;no, not even like this. We have no right to indulge our moods. I'm
      going to be really honest now. We're in danger from these natives, yes.
      But that's a small thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She moved a hand. &ldquo;Of course...&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The real danger is to you. And from me. Oh, my God, child, you're in
      danger from me!&rdquo; He covered his face with his hands; then, after a moment,
      steadied himself, and rose. &ldquo;I can't stay here and talk with you like
      this. I can't even help you. Already I've injured your name beyond
      repair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She broke in here with a low-voiced remark the mature character of which
      he did not, in his self-absorption, catch. &ldquo;I don't believe you know
      modern girls very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went on: &ldquo;So you see, I've hurt you, and now, when you need me most&mdash;oh,
      I know that!&mdash;I'm fading you. It's been a terrible mistake. But it's
      my job to get you to Ping Yang. That's all. No good talking. I'll go
      now'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you wouldn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must. I&mdash;there we are! I'm failing you, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if we're talking&mdash;or thinking&mdash;about the same things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Child, you're young! You don't understand! You don't seem to see how I've
      hurt you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I see what you mean. But that&mdash;it might be difficult, of
      course, for a while, but it isn't what I've been thinking of. No, please
      let me say this! It wouldn't be fair not to give me my chance to be honest
      too. As for that&mdash;hurting me&mdash;I came with my eyes open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Betty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please! I did. I deliberately decided to come with you. I knew they'd
      talk, but I didn't care&mdash;much. You see I had already made up my mind
      that we were to be married. We'd have to be, once you were free. The way
      we've felt. You came way out here, and then you didn't go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was weakness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can call it weakness, or something else. But I'm in the same boat.
      And if we couldn't let each other go then, it was bound to grow harder
      every day. I had to recognize that. That was where I crossed my Rubicon.
      Nothing else mattered very much after that. I came with you because I was
      all alone, and miserable, and&mdash;oh, I may as well say it...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, honesty's the only thing now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I simply had to. I couldn't face life any other way. I've been
      thinking it over and over and over. I see it now. I was just selfish. Love
      is selfishness, apparently. I fastened myself on you. I knew you had to
      have solitude, but I didn't seem to care. Perhaps you've hurt me. I don't
      know. But I am beginning to see that I've wrecked your life. I'm your job,
      now, just as you said. All those things you said on the ship have been
      coming up in my mind yesterday and to-day. Don't you suppose I can see it?
      My whole life right now is a demand on you.&rdquo; Her tone was not bitter, but
      sad, unutterably sad. &ldquo;You said, 'Strength is better.' I'm running up with
      you now a 'spiritual' debt greater than I can ever pay. You said, 'If any
      friend of mine&mdash;man or woman&mdash;-can't win his own battles, he or
      she had better go. To hell, if it comes to that.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was looking full at him now, wide-eyed, standing rigid, her hands
      extended a little way.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence; then, abruptly, without a word, without even a
      change of expression on his gloomy face, he left the room.
    </p>
    <h3>

    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hat night was
      Betty's Gethsemane. Again and again she lived through their strange
      quarrel over the half-eaten dinner here in her room. Her mind phrased and
      rephrased the wild strong things she had said to him. And these phrases
      now stung her, hurt her, as had none of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      But once again, after hours of tossing on the narrow folding cot&mdash;<i>his</i>
      cot&mdash;sleep of a sort came to her. She did not wake until half a
      hundred beams of sunshine were streaming in through the dilapidated paper
      squares.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose and peeped out into the courtyard. They were packing one of the
      saddles; John, and cook, and a soldier. Brachey was not in sight. He would
      be in his room then, across the corridor. She wondered if he had slept at
      all, then glanced guiltily at the cot. He would hardly lie on the unclean
      <i>kang</i>; very likely he had been forced to doze in a chair these two
      nights, while she found some real rest. There, again, she was using him,
      taking from him; and all he had asked of life was solitude, peace. For
      that he had foregone friends, a home, his country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then her eyes rested on a bit of white paper under the door. She quickly
      drew it in, and read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Dear, Dear Little Girl&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you of course saw this evening, it is simply impossible for me to
      speak rationally in matters of the affections. It is equally clear that by
      indulging my feelings toward you I have brought you nothing but
      unhappiness. This was inevitable. As I wrote you before I am not a social
      being. This fact was never so clear as now. I must be alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As regards the statements you have just made, indicating that you attach
      the blame for the present predicament to yourself, these are, of course,
      absurd. I'm sure you will come in time to see that. It will be a question
      then whether you will be able to bring yourself to forgive me for
      permitting matters to go so far as they have. That has been my weakness. I
      allowed my admiration for you and my desire for you to overcome my reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for the course you must pursue, it will be, of course, to go on as far
      as Ping Yang. There I will leave you. It may even prove possible, despite
      the malignant enmity of Mrs. Boatwright, to convince M. Pourmont and the
      others that we are guilty of nothing more than an error of judgment in an
      extremely difficult situation. Certainly I shall demand the utmost respect
      for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall make it a point to avoid you in the morning; and it will
      undoubtedly be best that we refrain so far as possible from speech during
      the remainder of our journey. I shall go on alone, as soon as you are safe
      at Ping Yang. I can not forgive myself for thus disturbing your life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can not trust myself to write further. It is my experience that words
      are dangerous things and not to be trifled with. I will merely add, in
      conclusion, and in wishing that you may at some later time find a mate who
      can bring into your life the qualities which you must have in order to
      attain happiness, and which I unquestionably lack, that I shall hope, in
      time, for your forgiveness.. Without that I should hardly care to live on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jonathan Brachey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soberly Betty read and reread this curious letter. Then for a moment her
      eyes rested on the cool signature, without so much as a &ldquo;sincerely yours,&rdquo;
       and then she looked at that first phrase, &ldquo;My Dear, Dear Little Girl&rdquo;; and
      then her eyes grew misty and she smiled, faintly, tenderly. Suddenly, this
      morning, life had changed color; the black mood was gone, like an illness
      that had passed its climax. The curious antagonism in their talk the
      evening before had, it seemed, cleared the air&mdash;at least for her. And
      now, all at once&mdash;she was beginning to feel quietly but glowingly
      exultant about it&mdash;nothing mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ate all the breakfast that John brought; then hurried out. It gave her
      pleasure to stand aside and watch the packing, and particularly to watch
      Brachey as he moved sternly about. He was a strong man, as her father had
      been strong. He hadn't a glimmer of humor, but she loved him for that. He
      had all at once become so transparent. In his lonely way he had expended
      so much energy fighting the illusions of happiness, that now when real
      happiness was offered him he fought harder than ever. Her thoughtful eyes
      followed his every motion; he was tall, strong, clean.
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart and mind, in their very austerity, were like a child's.
    </p>
    <p>
      So deep ran this sober new happiness, as she stood by the litter waiting
      until he came&mdash;austerely&mdash;and helped her in (she was waiting for
      the touch of his hand, averting her face to hide the smile that she
      couldn't altogether control) that only a warmly up-rushing little thought
      of her father that came just then could restore her poise. She cared now
      about nothing else, about only this man whom she now knew she loved with
      her whole being and the father she had so suddenly, shockingly lost. If
      only, in the different ways, she might have brought happiness to each of
      these strong men. If only she could have brought them together, her father
      and her lover; for each, she felt, had fine deep qualities that the other
      would be quick to perceive.
    </p>
    <p>
      All during the morning, feeling through every sensitive nerve-tip the
      nearness of this man who loved her and whom she loved, she rode through a
      land of rosy dreams. She felt again the power over life that she had felt
      during their first talk at T'ainan. Love had come; it absorbed her
      thoughts; it was right.... She exulted in the misty red hills with their
      deep purple shadows. She smiled at the absurd camels with the rings in
      their noses and the ragged, shaggy coats.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time, as the morning wore along, she became aware that he, too,
      was changing. Once, when he rode for a moment beside her Inter, he caught
      sight of her quietly radiant face and flushed and turned away. At lunch,
      by a roadside temple, under a tree, they talked about nothing with
      surprising ease. He was eager that she should draw and paint these
      beautiful hills of Hansi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the afternoon&mdash;they were riding down an open valley&mdash;he
      appeared again beside the litter. Impulsively she reached out her hand. He
      guided his pony close; leaned over and gripped it warmly. For a little
      while they rode thus; then, happening out of a confusion of impulses that,
      with whichever it began, was instantly communicated to the other, he bent
      down and she leaned out the little side door and their lips met.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cook, from his insecure seat on the pack-saddle, carolled his endless
      musical narrative. John rode in stolid silence; the merely human emotions
      were ages old and quite commonplace. Mr. Po merely glanced up as he
      trudged along in the dust, taking the little incident calmly for granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was that, unaccountably to themselves, the spin of these two lovers
      rebounded from acute depression to an exaltation that, however sobered by
      circumstance, touched the skirts of ecstasy. They rode on silently as on
      the other days> but now their hearts beat in happy unison. No longer was
      the situation of their relationship unreal to them; the unreality lay with
      the white world from which they had come and to which they must shortly
      return. The mission compound was but an immaterial memory, like an
      unpleasant moment in a long, beautiful journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening after dinner, they sat for a long time with her head on his
      shoulder dreamily talking of the mystery, their mystery, of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It had to be,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could only incline his head and compress his lips as he gazed out over
      her head down a long vista of years, during which he would, for better or
      worse, for richer or poorer, protect and cherish her. The old phrases from
      the marriage service rang in his thoughts like cathedral bells.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;1 don't believe we'll ever have those dreadful moods again,&rdquo; she
      murmured, later. &ldquo;At least, we won't misunderstand each other again. Not
      like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; he breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one thing is wrong, dear,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;I wish father could have
      known you. He'd have understood you. That's the only sad thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent. At last, after midnight, in a spirit of deepest
      consecration, he held her gently in his arms, kissed her good night, and
      went to his own room.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>EANTIME, M.
      Pourmont, at Ping Yang, was calling in his white assistants and sifting
      out the trustworthy among his native employees in preparation for
      withstanding a siege. He had swiftly carried out his plan of destroying
      the native huts that stood within a hundred yards of his compound. Such
      lumber and bricks as were of any value he had brought into the compound,
      using them to build two small redoubts at opposite comers of the walled-in
      rectangle and to increase the number of firing positions along the walls.
      From the redoubts the faces of the four walls and all of the hillside were
      commanded by the two machine guns. A wall of bricks and sand-bags was
      built up just within the compound gate so that the gate could be opened
      without exposing the interior to outside eyes or weapons. On all the roofs
      of the low stables and storehouses that bordered the walls were parapets
      of sand-bags.
    </p>
    <p>
      These elaborate preparations were meant as much to impress and intimidate
      the natives of the region as for actual defense. In the main, and in so
      far as they could be understood, the natives seemed friendly. Several
      thousand of the young men among them had been at various times on M.
      Pourmont's pay-roll. The trade in food supplies, brick and other necessary
      articles was locally profitable. And the shen magistrate was keenly aware
      of the commercial and military strength represented by the foreigners.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were&mdash;engineers, instrument men, stake-boys, supply agents,
      clerks, timekeepers, foremen and others&mdash;fourteen Frenchmen, eight
      Australians, three Belgians, six Englishmen, two Scotch engineers, four
      Americans, two Russians. Three of the Chinese had served as
      non-commissioned officers in the British Wei Hai Wei regiment in 1900.
      There were a few native foremen who had been trained in the modern Chinese
      army of Yuan Shi K'ai. The total force, including M. Pourmont himself and
      his immediate office force, came to forty-six white and about eighty
      able-bodied Chinese. These latter were now being put through hours of
      military drill every day in conspicuous places about the hillside.
    </p>
    <p>
      A number of men acted as intelligence runners, and the activity of these,
      supplemented by occasional word from the yamen of the shen magistrate,
      kept M. Pourmont informed of the march of events in the province. Thus it
      could not have been twelve hours after Brachey bore the news of Griggsby
      Doane's death to the mission at T'ainan-fu before M. Pourmont as well knew
      of it, the word coming hy wire to the local yamen and thence passing in
      whispers to the compound on the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, late one afternoon, Doane's pretty little daughter came in, escorted
      by the American journalist, Jonathan Brachey, and a young secretary from
      the yamen of the provincial judge disguised as a muleteer. Brachey at once
      volunteered to help and was put in charge of preparing two small lookout
      posts on the upper hill. He was uncommunicative and dryly self-sufficient
      in manner, but proved a real addition to the establishment, contributing
      the great Anglo-Saxon quality of confidence and tone. Though M. Pour-mont
      would have preferred a more sociable man. His was a lonely life. He loved
      talk&mdash;even in broken English&mdash;for its own sake. He had, himself,
      vivacity and humor. And it was a disappointment that this Brachey didn't
      know <i>Çhambertin</i> from <i>vin ordinaire</i>, and cared little for
      either.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Miss Doane touched his heart, she was so pretty, so quick in her
      bright graceful way, yet so white and sad. But always brave, as if
      sustained by inner faith. She asked at once to be put to work, and quickly
      adapted herself to the atmosphere of Mme. Pourmont's workroom in the
      residence, where Madarhe's two daughters and the English trained nurse
      were busy directing the Chinese sewing women.... It transpired that the
      Mrs. Boatwright who was in charge at the mission had refused to save
      herself and those in her charge, so the Mademoiselle had come on
      independently. This, thought M. Pourmont, showed a courage and enterprise
      suggestive of her father.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hat night M.
      Pourmont telegraphed Elmer Boatwright confirming the news of Doane's
      death, and urging an immediate attempt to get through to Ping Yang.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the preceding day he had sent a party of twelve men, white and Chinese,
      in command of an Australian engineer, to Shau T'ing, on the Eastern
      Border, to get the supplies that had been shipped down from Peking. These
      men returned on the following day; and among the cases and bales of
      supplies borne on the long train of carts they guarded were the bodies of
      two dead Chinese and a Russian youth with a bullet in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      News came then that a large force of Lookers had started in an easterly
      direction from Hung Chan. And Boatwright wired that the mission party was
      at last under way, seven whites and fifty natives.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Pourmont at once sent a party of forty mounted men westward along the
      highway, commanded by an Englishman named Swain. This small force fought a
      pitched battle with the Looker band that had been evaded by Brachey,
      suffering several casualties. A native was sent on ahead, riding all
      night, with a note to Boatwright advising great haste. But it was
      difficult for the mission party to travel with any speed, as it had been
      found impossible to secure horses or carts for many of the Chinese
      converts, and not one of the missionaries would consent to leave these
      charges behind. It became necessary therefore for Swain to move a
      half-day's march farther west than had been intended. He joined the
      missionaries shortly after the advance guard of the Western Lookers had
      begun an attack on the inn compound. Already six or seven of the secondary
      Christians had been dragged out and shot or burned to death when Swain led
      his white and yellow troopers in among them, shooting right and left.
      There must have been several hundred of the Lookers; but they amounted to
      little more than a disorganized mob, and as soon as they found their
      comrades falling around them, screaming in agony and fright, they threw
      away their rifles and fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swain at once ordered out the entire mission company, mounted as many as
      possible of the frightened fugitives on the horses of his troop, and with
      such extra carts as he could commandeer in the village for his wounded,
      himself and his uninjured men on foot, he pushed rapidly hack toward Ping
      Yang. The few Chinese who lagged were left in native houses. The horses
      that fell were dragged off the road and shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man Swain, though he concerns us in this narrative only incidentally,
      was one of a not unfamiliar type on the China coast. He was hardly thirty
      years of age, a blond Briton, handsome, athletic, evidently a man of some
      education and breeding. He had once spoken of serving as a subaltern in
      the Boer War. A slightly elusive reputation as a Shanghai gambler had
      floated after him to Ping Yang. He was at times a hard drinker, as his
      lined face indicated, faint, purplish markings already forming a fine
      network under the skin of his nose. His blue eyes were always slightly
      bloodshot. He never spoke of his own people. And it had been noted that
      after a few drinks he was fond of quoting Kipling's <i>The Lost Legion</i>.
      Yet on this little expedition, unknown to the archives of any war
      department, Swain proved himself a hero. He brought all but twelve of the
      fifty-seven mission folk and eight of his own wounded safely to Ping Yang,
      leaving three of his Chinese buried back there. And himself sustained a
      bullet wound through the flesh of his left forearm and a severe knife cut
      on the left hand.... The drift of opinion among respectable people along
      Bubbling Well Road in Shanghai, as here in Ping Yang, was that Swain would
      hardly do. Certain of these mission folk, in particular Miss Hemphill,
      whose philosophy of life could hardly be termed comprehensive, were later
      to find their mental attitude toward their rescuer somewhat perplexing.

    <p>
      Though she evidently tried to be quiet about it, Mrs. Boatwright's first
      act was troublesome. She had been taken in, of course, with the other
      white women, by the Pourmonts; in the big house. Here the principal three
      of them&mdash;Dr. Cassin on her one hand and Miss Hemphill on the other&mdash;were
      put down at the dinner table on that first evening directly opposite
      Betty. Miss Hemphill flushed a little, bit her lip, then inclined her head
      with what was clearly enough meant to be distant courtesy. Dr. Cassin,
      already too deeply occupied with her wounded to waste thought on merely
      personal matters, bowed coolly. But Mrs. Boatwright stared firmly past the
      girl at the screen of carved wood that stood behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty bent her head over her plate. She had of course dreaded this first
      encounter; all of her courage had been called on to bring her into the
      dining-room; but her own sense of personal loss and injury had lately been
      so overshadowed by the growing tragedy in which they were dwelling that
      she had forgotten with what complete cruelty and consistency this woman's
      stern sense of character could function. She had lost, too, in the
      mounting sober beauty of her love for Brachey, any lingering sense of
      wrong-doing. Here at Ping Yang Brachey commanded, she knew triumphantly,
      the respect of the little community.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were thinking, he and she, only at moments of themselves. Indeed,
      days passed without a stolen half-hour together. She gloried in her
      knowledge that he would neglect no smallest duty to indulge his emotions
      in companionship with her; nor would she neglect duty for him........And
      the people here were all so kind to her, so friendly! The presence of this
      grim personally was an intrusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner Mrs. Boatwright went directly to M. Pourmont in his study and
      told him that it would be necessary for her to sleep and eat in another
      building. She would give no reasons, nor would she in any pleasant way
      soften her demand. Accordingly, the Pourmonts, always courteous, always
      cheerful, made at once a new arrangement in the crowded compound. Some of
      the Australian young men were turned out into a tent; and the Boatwrights,
      accompanied by their assistants, were settled by midnight in the smaller
      building immediately adjoining the residence. Mr. Boatwright protested a
      little to his wife, but was silenced. All he could do was to make some
      extreme effort to treat the Pourmonts with courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so Betty, when in the morning she again mustered her courage to enter
      the dining-room, found them gone. And instantly she knew why... . She
      couldn't eat. All day forlorn, her mind a cavern of shadows, she put
      herself in the way of meeting Brachey, but did not find him until late in
      the afternoon. He was coming in then from the outworks up the hill. She
      stood waiting just within the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been thinking constantly, since the one misunderstanding, of the
      cablegram that would announce his freedom. In his eagerness he had
      expected to find it waiting at Ping Yang. Day after day native runners got
      through to the telegraph station and brought messages for others... To
      Betty now it seemed the one thing that could arm her against the stern
      judgment in Mrs. Boatwright's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey's knickerbockers and stockings were red with mud. He wore a canvas
      shooting coat of M. Pourmont. He was lean, strong, quick of tread.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drew aside, into a corner of the wall of sandbags. She saw the
      momentary light in his tired eyes when they rested on her; gravely
      beautiful eyes she thought them. Her fingers caught his sleeve; her eyes
      timidly searched his face, and read an answer there to the question in her
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't heard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He slowly shook his head. &ldquo;No, dear, not yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her gaze wavered away from him &ldquo;It's got to come,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;It isn't as
      if there weren't a positive understanding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she murmured, but without conviction. &ldquo;Of course. It's got to
      come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were silent a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I'll go back to the house,&rdquo; she breathed, then. &ldquo;Keep strong,
      dear,&rdquo; said he very gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. I will. It's helped, just seeing you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he looked after her, his heart full of a gloomy beauty, he longed to
      call her back and in some way restore her confidence. But the appearance
      of the mission folk had shaken him, as well, this day. The mere presence
      of Mrs. Boatwright in the compound was suddenly again a living force. Up
      there on the hillside, driving his native workmen through the long hot
      hours, he had faced unnerving thoughts. For Mrs. Boatwright had brought
      him out of the glamour of his love; she, that sense of her, if merely by
      stirring his mind to resentment and resistance, restored for the time his
      keen logical faculty. He saw again clearly the mission compound at
      T'ainan-fu. And he saw Griggsby Doane&mdash;huge, strong, the face that
      might so easily be tender, working with passion in the softly flickering
      light from a Chinese lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had given Griggsby Doane a pledge as solemn as one man can give
      another. He had, because Doane was so suddenly dead, broken that pledge.
      But now he knew, coldly, clearly, that of material proof that Doane was
      dead neither he nor M. Pourmont nor these difficult folk from T'ainan held
      a shred.
    </p>
    <h3>
      4
    </h3>
    <p>
      Early on the following morning&mdash;at about three o'clock&mdash;a small
      shell exploded in the compound. Within five minutes two others fell
      outside the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      At once the open spaces within the walls were filled with Chinese, none
      fully dressed, talking, shouting, wailing. Among them, a moment later,
      moved white men, cartridge pouches and revolvers hastily slung on, rifles
      in hand, quietly ordering them back to their quarters and themselves
      taking positions along the walls. The crews of the two machine guns
      promptly joined the sentries in the redoubts. M. Pourmont went about
      calmly, pleasantly, supervising the final preparations. Two small parties,
      one led by Swain, the other by Brachey, went up the hillside to the men in
      the rifle pits there. A few trusted natives slipped out on scouting
      expeditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the first faint color appeared in the eastern sky, and the darkness
      slowly gave way through the morning twilight to the young day, the walls
      were lined with anxious faces. Strained eyes peered up and down the
      hillside for the first glimpse of the enemy. Surmises and conjectures flew
      from lip to lip&mdash;the attackers were thousands strong; American,
      French and English troops were already on the way down from Peking; no
      troops could be spared; such a relieving party had already been
      intercepted and driven back as McCalla had been driven back in 1900; the
      Shau T'ing bridge was down, the telegraph lines were broken, old Kang had
      beheaded Pao and seized the entire provincial government, was, indeed, in
      personal command here at Ping Yang. So the rumors ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daylight spread slowly over the hillside. Far up among the native houses
      and down near the village groups of strange figures could be seen moving
      about. They wore a uniform much like that the Boxers had worn, except that
      coat and trousers were alike red and only the turban yellow. At intervals
      shells fell here and there about the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in his study in the residence M. Pourmont, by breakfast time, had
      reports from several of his scouts and was able to sift the rumors down to
      a basis of fact. Several thousand Lookers were already in the neighborhood
      and others were on the way. The Shau T'ing bridge was gone, and it was
      true that the local shen magistrate had been cut off from telegraphic
      communication with the outside world. And Kang was at the moment
      establishing headquarters five <i>li</i> to the westward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entrenched parties up the hillside lay unseen and unheard in their
      trenches, awaiting the signal to fire. The compound was still now.
      Breakfast was carried about to the men on duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward nine o'clock considerable activity was noted up the hill, beyond
      the outposts. Several squads of the red and yellow figures appeared in the
      open apparently digging out a level emplacement on the steep hillside.
      Then a small field gun was dragged into view from behind a native compound
      wall and set in position. The distance was hardly more than two hundred
      yards; they meant to fire point-blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Pourmont went out to the upper redoubt and studied the scene through
      field-glasses. The men begged permission to fire, but the bearded French
      engineer ordered them to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little red and yellow men were a long time at their preparations. They
      moved about as if confident that no white man's eyes could discern them.
      Finally they gathered back of the gun. There was some further delay. Then
      the gun was fired, and a shell whirred over the compound and on across the
      valley, exploding against the opposite hillside, near a temple, in a cloud
      of smoke and red dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was still another wait. Then a shell carried away part of a chimney
      of the residence. The sound of distant cheers floated down-hill on the
      soft breeze. The little men clustered about the gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Puurmont lowered his glasses and nodded. The machine gun opened fire,
      spraying its stream of bullets directly on the crowded figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the men standing and kneeling in the redoubt the scene, despite the
      rattle of the gun and the wisps of smoke curling about them and the
      choking smell, was one of impersonal calm. The Australian working the gun
      was quietly methodical about it. The crowded figures up the hill seemed to
      sit or lie down deliberately enough. Others appeared to be moving away
      slowly toward the houses, though when M. Pourmont gave them a look through
      his glasses it became evident that their legs were moving rapidly. Soon
      all who could get away were gone, leaving several heaped-up mounds of red
      near the gun and smaller dots of red scattered along the path of the
      retreat. With a few scattering shots the Australian sat back on his heels
      and glanced up at M. Pourmont. &ldquo;Heats up pretty fast,&rdquo; he remarked
      casually, indicating the machine gun.
    </p>
    <h3>

    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> shout, sounded up
      the hill. All turned. Swain had mounted to the parapet of his rifle pit
      and was waving his rifle. His half dozen men, white and Chinese, followed,
      all shouting now. Over to the right, from the other pit, the lean figure
      of Jonathan Brachey appeared, followed by others. Then they started up the
      hillside. Like the retreating Lookers they seemed to move very slowly; but
      the glasses made it clear that they were running and scrambling feverishly
      up the slope, fourteen of them, pausing only at intervals to fire toward
      the houses, where a few puffs of white smoke appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached the Chinese sun, turned it around and, five or six of them,
      began running it down-hill. The others lingered, clustering together. A
      shot from one of the red heaps was met by a blow of a clubbed rifle; that
      was seen by the Australian through the glasses. There were more shots from
      the compound walls beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Australian quietly returned the glasses to his chief, sighted along
      his machine gun, and sprayed bullets along those walls, first to the left
      of the raiding party, then, very carefully, to the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Pourmont descended to the compound and ordered a party of coolies out
      with wheelbarrows. These began mounting the slope, obediently, painfully.
      The raiders dropped behind the little heaps of dead and waited. To the
      many watching eyes along the wall it seemed as if those deliberate coolies
      would never end their climb; inch by inch they seemed to move. Even the
      more rapidly moving gun, descending the slope, seemed to crawl. When it
      did at length draw near, the eager observers noted that the men handling
      it were all Chinese; the whites had stayed up there. Swain was there, and
      Brachey, and the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty witnessed the scene from an upper window of the residence with Mme.
      Pourmont and her daughters. She heard the rat-tat-tat of the machine gun;
      through a pair of glasses she saw the red-clad Lookers fall, all without
      clearly realizing that this was battle and death. It seemed a calm enough
      picture. But when Brachey started up the hill her heart stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      More and more slowly, as the climb told on the porters, the barrows moved
      up the slope; but at last they reached their destination. Then all worked
      like ants about them. Within ten minutes all were back in the compound
      creaking and squealing, each on its high center wheel, under the loads of
      shells.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty watched Brachey through the glasses. Naively she assumed that he
      would return to her after passing through such danger. And when she saw
      him drop casually into the little pit on the hillside it seemed to her
      that she couldn't wait out the day. Now that she had watched him leading
      his men straight into mortal danger&mdash;had so nearly, in her own heart,
      lost him&mdash;she began to sense the terrible power of love. All that had
      gone before in this strange relationship of theirs seemed like the play of
      children beside her present sense of him as her other self. Indeed the
      danger seemed now to be&mdash;she thought of it, in lucid moments, as a
      danger&mdash;that she should cease to care about outside opinion. Her
      heart throbbed with pride in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dusk the outposts were relieved. When Brachey entered the gate, Betty
      was there, waiting, a tremulous smile hovering about her tender little
      mouth and about her misty eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, in surprise and pleasure. She gave him a hand, hesitantly, then
      the other; then, impulsively, her arms went around his neck.... His men
      straggled wearily past, their day's work done. Not one looked back. She
      was almost sorry, for that and for the dusk. Arm in arm they entered the
      compound and walked to the steps of the residence.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, three shells struck within the compound. One wrecked a corner
      of Mme. Pourmont's kitchen. Another carried away a section of galvanized
      iron roof and killed a horse. The third destroyed a tent, killing a
      Chinese woman and wounding a man and two girls. Thus, before morning, Dr.
      Cassam and her helpers were at the grim business of patching and restoring
      the piteous debris of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      By daylight the red and yellow' lines were closed about the compound.
      Shells roared by at intervals all day, and bullets rattled against the
      walls. The upper windows of the residence were barricaded now with
      sand-bags. Five more were wounded during the day, two of them white. Enemy
      trenches appeared, above and below the compound. During the following
      night M. Pourmont set a considerable force of men at work running a sap
      out to the rifle pits, and digging in other outposts on the lower slope.
      His night runners moved with difficulty, but brought in reports of feasts
      and orgies at Kang's headquarters down the valley, where, surrounded by
      his full retinue, the old Manchu was preparing to revel in slaughter. As
      the days passed, the sense of danger grew deeper; the faces one saw about
      the compound wore a dogged expression. An armed guard stood over the
      storehouses, men were killed and wounded, and women and children. They
      talked, heavily where the casual was intended, of settling down to a
      siege. They spoke of other, larger sieges; of Mafeking and Ladysmith of
      recent memory. But no one, now, mentioned the prospects of early relief.
      One night Mr. Po went out with a Chinese soldier on a scouting trip; and
      neither returned. On the following night, one of the Wei Hai Wei men was
      sent. At daybreak they found his head, wrapped in a cloth, just inside the
      gate. The enemy had crept close enough, despite the outposts, to toss it
      over the wall... After this, for a time, no word went out or came in.

      slept alone in a small room; his wife, Miss Hemphill and Dr. Cassin
      occupied a large room in the same building. One night, tossing on his cot,
      the prey of nightmares, Boatwright started up, cold with sweat, and sat
      shivering in the dark room. Outside sounded the pop&mdash;pop, pop&mdash;of
      the snipers. But there was another sound that had crashed in among the
      familiar noises of his dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came again&mdash;a light tapping at his door. He tried to get his
      breath; then tried to call out, &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; But his voice came only in a
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn't his wife; she wouldn't have knocked. He had not before been
      disturbed at night; it would mean something serious, nothing good. It
      could mean nothing good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elmer Boatwright was by no means a simple coward. He rose, shivering with
      this strange sense of cold; struck a light; and candle in hand advanced to
      the door. Here, for a moment he waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the tapping sounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door; and beheld, dimly outlined in the shadowy hall, clad
      in rags, face seamed and haggard, eyes staring out of deep hollows, the
      gigantic frame of Griggsby Doane, leaning on his old walking stick. He was
      hatless, and his hair was matted. A stubble of beard covered the lower
      half of his face. His left shoulder, under the torn coat, was bandaged
      with the caked, bloodstained remnant of his shirt.

      chin sagged a little way. For a long moment he stood motionless, making no
      sound; then, without change of expression on his gray thin face, he moved
      with a slow gliding motion backward, backward, until his knees struck the
      bed; and stood, bent forward, his palsied hand tipping the candle so far
      that the hot tallow splashed in white drops on the matting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the giant figure stirred, straightened up, came slowly into the
      room; closed the door, leaned back against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Boatwright spoke, slowly, huskily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&mdash;it is you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; It was plainly an effort for Doane to speak. &ldquo;But&mdash;but I don't
      see how you could have got through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men do get through now and then.&rdquo; Doane spoke with the quick irritability
      of the man whose powers of nervous resistance have been tried to the
      uttermost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're wounded. You must be tired.&rdquo; Boatwright was quite incoherent.
      &ldquo;You'd better lie down. Here&mdash;take my bed! How did you ever find me?
      How did you get in in the first place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll sit for a moment.&rdquo; Duane lowered himself painfully to the bed.
      &ldquo;Betty is here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty? Oh, yes! We're all safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don't know exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't <i>know!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Madame Pourmont has been caring for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that she is ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Oh, no! One moment. You've been hurt. I must tell the others. You
      must have attention at once. Mary Cassin is right here&mdash;and my wife.&rdquo;
       The little man moved to the door. His color was returning now; he was
      talking rapidly, out of a confused mind. &ldquo;You must have had a terrible
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They left me for dead at the Hung Chan Gate. I crawled to the house of a
      convert.&rdquo; Doane's great eyes, staring out of shadowy hollows, burned with
      tragic memories. Those eyes held Boatwright fascinated; he shivered
      slightly. &ldquo;As soon as I felt able to travel I started toward T'ainan.
      Several of our native people came with me, walking at night, biding by
      day. On the way we learned that you had left. So I came here. I must see
      Betty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not like this,&rdquo; the little man blurted out. Doane's eyes wandered
      down over his muddy tattered clothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll call the others first,&rdquo; said Boatwright He set down his candle on
      the wash-stand, just inside the door, and slipped out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane sat erect, without moving. His eyes stared at the candle and at the
      grotesque wavering shadows of the wash-howl and pitcher on the wall. At
      each small night sound he started nervously&mdash;the scratching of a
      mouse, a voice in the compound, a distant sputter of shots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boatwright slipped back into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're coming,&rdquo; he said breathlessly. &ldquo;In a minute. Mary sleeps in most
      of her clothes anyway, these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it about Betty?&rdquo; Doane asked sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;she's quite all right. We don't see much of her, not being in
      the same house. We're all pretty busy here, these days. It's an ugly time.
      I&mdash;I was just wondering. I don't know what we can dress you in. You
      could hardly wear my things. One of the Australians is nearly as big as
      you. Perhaps in the morning...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice had risen a little, nearly to the querulous, as he hurriedly
      drew on his outer clothing. From the way his eyes wandered about the room
      it appeared that his thoughts had run far afield. And he was clumsy about
      the buttons. Even the intensely preoccupied Doane became aware of this,
      and for a moment studied him with a puzzled look.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man's tongue ran on. &ldquo;Mary'll fix you up for now. Sleep'll be
      the best thing. In the morning you can use my shaving things. And I'll
      look up that Australian.... There they are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hurried to the door. Dr. Cassin came in, greeted
    </p>
    <p>
      Griggsby Doane with a warm hand-clasp, and at once examined his shoulder.
      Boatwright she sent over to the dispensary for bandages.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later Mrs. Boatwright appeared, her strong person wrapped in a
      quilted robe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a great relief,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We had given you up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Duane's eyes fastened eagerly on this woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you sent word to Betty?&rdquo; he asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boatwright looked at him for a moment, without replying, then moved
      deliberately to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don't move,&rdquo; cautioned Dr. Cassin, who was working on his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you sent word?&rdquo; Doane shot the question after Mrs. Boatwright.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; cried Doane then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please!&rdquo; said Dr. Cassin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something is wrong! What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boatwright was standing squarely before the window now, looking out
      into the dark courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? Tell me! Is she here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Mr Doane&rdquo;&mdash;thus the physician&mdash;&ldquo;I can not work if you
      move. Yes, she is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why do you act in this strange way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Cassin compressed her lips. All her working adult life had been spent
      under the direction of this man. Never before had she seen him in the
      slightest degree beaten down. She had never even seen him tired. In her
      steady, objective mind he stood for unshakable, enduring strength. But
      now, twitching nervously under her firm hands, staring out of feverish
      eyes after the uncompromising woman by the window, his huge frame
      emaciated, spent with loss of blood, with suffering and utter physical and
      nervous exhaustion, he had reached, she knew', at last, the limits of his
      great strength. He had, perhaps, even passed those limits; for there was a
      morbid condition evident in him, he seemed not wholly sane, as if the
      trials he had passed through had been too great for his iron will, or as
      if there was something else, some consuming fire in him, burning secretly
      but strongly, out of control. All this she saw and felt. His temperature
      was not dangerously high, slightly more than two degrees above normal. His
      pulse was rapid, but no weaker than was to be expected. Worry might
      explain it; worry for them all, but particularly for Betty. Though she
      found this diagnosis not wholly satisfactory. Of course it might be, after
      all, nothing more than exhaustion. Sleep was the first thing. After that
      it would be a simpler matter to study his case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, starling up suddenly, wrenching himself free from her skilful hands,
      Doane stood over her, staring past her at the woman by the window'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you please go to Betty,&rdquo; he said, in a voice that trembled with
      feeling, &ldquo;and tell her that I am here. Wake her. She must know at once.
      And try to prepare her mind&mdash;she mustn't see me first like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a breathless pause. Then Mrs. Boatwright turned and moved
      deliberately toward the door. Then she paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll see her?&rdquo; cried the father. &ldquo;At once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Boatwright. &ldquo;No. I am sorry. I would like to spare you
      pain at this time, Griggsby Doane. But I do not feel that I can see her.
      I'll tell you though, what I will do. I'll tell Monsieur Pourmont.&rdquo; And
      she went out.

      door when it abruptly opened. Elmer Boatwright stood there, looking after
      his wife as she went along the dark hallway. He came in then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I brought the bandages,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must sit down again,&rdquo; said the physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane, evidently bewildered, obeyed. And she began bandaging his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      He even sat quietly. He seemed to be making a determined effort to control
      his thoughts. When he finally spoke he seemed almost his old self.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elmer, something is wrong with Betty. Whatever it is, I have a right to
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Boatwright cleared his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Cassin broke the silence that followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Doane,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;sit still here and try to listen to what I am
      going to tell you. We have been disturbed about Betty. I won't attempt to
      conceal that. This Mr. Brachey&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brachey? Is he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please! You must keep quiet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is it? Tell me&mdash;now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm trying to. Mr. Brachey came to the compound the morning after you
      left&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he gave me his word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You really must let me tell this in my own way. He brought the news of
      your death. He had it from Pao's yamen. He demanded that we all leave
      T'ainan at once, with him. If he gave you his word, it is probable that he
      regarded your death as a release. Well....&rdquo; For a moment she bent silently
      over her task of bandaging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Tell me?&rdquo; Doane's voice was quieter still. More and more, to
      Boatwright, who stood by the wash-stand lingering a towel, he looked,
      felt, like the old Griggsby Doane... except his eyes; they were fixed
      intently on the matting; they were wide open, staring open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well... Mrs. Boatwright felt that it was not yet the time to go. She
      distrusted this man. So we stayed a few days longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not telling me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I am coming to it. Betty... Betty felt that she couldn't let him go
      alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a hushed, almost a reflective voice Doane asked: &ldquo;So she came with
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Cassin bowed. Elmer Boatwright bowed. Doane glanced up briefly, and
      took them in; then his gaze centered again on the matting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they are here now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty is staying with Madame Pourmont. Mr. Brachey is living in a tent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where? What tent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elmer Boatwright did not wait to hear this question answered, or the rush
      of other palliative phrases that were pressing nervously on the tip of Dr
      Cas-sin's not unsympathetic tongue. Never had he heard the quiet menace in
      Griggsby Doane's voice that was in it as he almost calmly uttered those
      three words, &ldquo;Where? What tent?&rdquo; He could nut himself think clearly; his
      mind was a blur of fears and nervous impulses. Doane wasn't normal; that
      was plain. Dr. Cassin's bare announcement was a blow so severe that even
      as he framed that tense question he was struggling to control the blind
      wild forces that were ravaging that giant frame of his. Once wholly out of
      control, he might do anything. He might kill Brachey. Yes, easily that! It
      was in his eyes.... And so, without a plan, all confused impulses, Elmer
      Boatwright slipped out, closing the door behind him. On the outer sill of
      the little building he paused, trying desperately to think; but, failing
      in this effort, harried through the night to Brachey's tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was, of course, far from understanding himself. It was a moment in
      which no small dogmatic mind, once touched by the illogic of merely human
      sympathy, could hope to understand itself. Though he and Brachey were
      barely speaking, he had watched the man during the capture of the Chinese
      gun and ammunition. And since that incident he had observed that Brachey
      was steadily winning the respect of all in the compound. The confusing
      thought was that a sinner could do that. For he believed, with his wife,
      and Miss Hemphill, that Brachey and Betty had sinned. Dr. Cassin had been
      more guarded in her judgment but probably she believed it, too. Sin, of
      course, to what may without unpleasant connotation be termed the
      professionally religious mind, is a definite, really a technical fact. In
      the faith of the Boatwrights it could be atoned only by an inner
      conviction followed by the blessing of the Holy Spirit. No mere good
      conduct, no merely admirable human qualities, could save the sinner. And
      neither Betty nor Brachey had shown the slightest sign of the regenerative
      process. In Mrs. Boatwright's judgment, therefore, since she was a woman
      of utter humorless logic, of unconquerable faith in conscience, the two
      stood condemned. But her husband, in this time of tragic stress, was
      discovering certain merely human qualities that were bound to prove
      disconcerting to his professed philosophy. He wanted, now, to help
      Brachey; and yet, as he ran through courtyard after courtyard, he couldn't
      wholly subdue certain strong misgivings as to what his wife might think if
      she knew.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>efore the tent he
      hesitated. The flap was tied; he shook it, with a trembling hand. He
      heard, then, the steady breathing of the man within. He tried knocking on
      the pole, through the canvas, but without effect on the sleeper. Then,
      with a curious sensation of guilt, he reached in and untied the flap,
      above, then below; and passed cautiously in. The night was warm. Brachey
      lay uncovered, dressed, as Boatwright saw when he struck a match to make
      certain of his man, in all but coat, collar and shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boatwright blew out the match. For another moment he stood wondering at
      himself; then laid a hand on the sleeper's shoulder. Brachey started up
      instantly; swung his feet to the floor; said in a surprisingly alert,
      cautious voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Elmer Boatwright.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; was Brachey's reply to this. He quietly lighted the candle that
      stood on a small table by the head of his cut. Then he added the single
      word, &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come on a peculiar errand, Mr. Brachey...&rdquo; Boatwright was fumbling
      for words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is little time for talk. A queer situation... let me say this&mdash;when
      you came to the mission and asked us to leave T'ainan with you it was
      under the supposition that Griggsby Doane was dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.... You mean that now... that the news was inaccurate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Boatwright inclined his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is alive, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Well... it is... I must ask you to consider the situation calmly. It is
      difficult.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Boatwright felt the man's eyes on him, coolly surveying him. It did seem a
      bit absurd to be cautioning this strange being to be calm. Had he ever
      been otherwise? Here he was, roused abruptly from slumber, listening, and
      looking, like a judge. He said now with quick understanding:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Boatwright's head inclined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he ever get through?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We haven't heard the details yet. There's so much else.... I want to make
      it plain to you that he isn't altogether himself. He has evidently been
      through a terrible experience. He was wounded. He has some fever now, I
      believe.... Let me put it this way. He has just now learned that you are
      here&mdash;-that you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I brought his daughter here?&rdquo; The remark was cool, clear, decisive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;yes. Now please understand me. He isn't himself. The news
      shocked him. I could see that. My suggestion is&mdash;well, that you move
      over to the residence for the rest of the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see&mdash;Mr. Doane asked where you might be found, in what tent. He
      has had no time to reflect over the situation. His present mood is&mdash;well,
      as I said, not normal. I've thought that to-morrow&mdash;after he has
      slept&mdash;some&mdash;we can prevail on him to consider it calmly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that he may attack me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;yes. It's quite possible. Monsieur Pour-mont would take you in
      now. I'm sure. In the morning you'll be back in your trenches. That will
      give us time to...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice died out. His gaze anxiously followed Brachey's movements. The
      man had buttoned on his collar, and was knotting his tie before the little
      square mirror that hung on the rear tent-pole. Next he brushed his hair.
      Then he got into his coat. And then he discovered that he was in his
      stocking feet. That bit of absent-mindedness was the only sign he gave of
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I might suggest that you hurry a little,&rdquo; thus Boatwright... &ldquo;it's
      possible that he's on his way here now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked Brachey coolly, raising his head. &ldquo;Oh&mdash;you mean Doane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I really think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey waved him to be still. He moved to the tent opening, peered out
      into the night, then turned and looked straight at his caller, slightly
      pursing his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Mr. Doane?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was in my room. But you're not&mdash;you don't mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to see him, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that's impossible. He may kill you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has that to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This blunt question proved difficult to meet. Boatwright found himself
      saying, rather weakly, &ldquo;I'm sure everything can be explained later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The time to explain is now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this, and a slight added sound that might have been an indication of
      impatience, Brachey strode out.
    </p>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>or a moment
      Boatwright stood in the paralysis of fright; then, catching his breath, he
      ran out after this strangely resolute man; quickly caught up with him, but
      found himself ignored. He even talked&mdash;incoherently&mdash;as his
      short legs tried to keep pace with the swift long stride of the other. He
      didn't himself know what he was saying. Nor did he stop when Brachey's arm
      moved as if to brush him off; though he perhaps had been clinging to that
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey stopped, looking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the house, isn't it?&rdquo; he remarked; then turned in toward the
      steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door burst open then, and a huge shadowy figure plunged out. A woman's
      voice followed: &ldquo;I must ask you to please come back, Mr. Doane. Really, if
      you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the name&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Doane&rdquo;&mdash;Brachey stopped short (one foot was
      already on the first of the three or four steps) and stiffened, his
      shoulders drawn back, his head high, Doane, too, stopped, peering down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Doane,&rdquo; said the younger man, firmly but perhaps in a slightly louder
      tone than was necessary, &ldquo;I am Jonathan Brachey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A hush fell on the group of them&mdash;Brachey waiting at the bottom step,
      Boatwright just behind him. Dr. Cassin barely visible in the shadows of
      the porch, silhouetted faintly against the light of a candle somewhere
      within, and Griggsby Doane staring down in astonishment at the man who
      stood looking straight up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey apparently was about to speak again. Perhaps he did begin.
      Boatwright found it impossible afterward to explain in precise detail just
      what took place. But the one clear fact was that Doane, with an
      exclamation that was not a word, seemed to leap down the steps, waving his
      stick about his head. There was the sound of a few heavy blows; and then
      Brachey lay huddled in a heap on the the walk, and Doane stood over him,
      breathing very hard..
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Cassin hurried down the steps and knelt lie-side the silent figure
      there. To Elmer Boatwright she said, briskly: &ldquo;My medicine case is in your
      room. Bring it at once, please? And bring water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Boatwright vaguely recalled, afterward, that he muttered, &ldquo;I beg your
      pardon,&rdquo; as he finished past Doane and ran up the steps. And he heard the
      sound of some, one running heavily toward them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came out the scene was curiously changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the natives were there, and one or two whites. An iron lantern
      with many perforations to let out the candle-light stood on the tiles. One
      of the Chinese held another. Dr. Cassin was seated on the ground examining
      a wound on Brachey's scalp; and the man himself was struggling back toward
      consciousness, moving his arms restlessly, and muttering.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the voice that dominated the little group that stood awkwardly about
      was the voice of M. Pourmont.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane had sunk down on the steps, his head in his hands. And over him,
      somewhat out of breath, gesturing emphatically with raised forefinger, the
      engineer was speaking as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Doane, it gives me ze great plaisir to know zat you do not die.
      To you here I offair ze vel-come viz all my 'eart. But zis I mus' say. It
      is here <i>la guerre</i>. It is I who am here ze commandair. An' I now'
      comman' you, Alonsieur Doane, zer mus' be here no more of ze mattair
      personel. We here fight togezzer, as one, not viz each ozzer. You have
      made ze attack on a gentleman zat mus' be spare' to us, a gentleman ver'
      strong, ver' brave, who fear nozzing at all. It is not pairmit' zat you
      make 'arm at Monsieur Brashayee. Zis man is one I need. It is on 'im zat I
      lean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Boatwright found himself breaking in, all eagerness, all nerves:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had only known how it was! Mr. Brachey insisted on coming straight
      to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Boatright, if you please! I mus' have here ze quiet! Monsieur
      Doane, you vill go at once to bed. It is so I order you. Go at once to
      bed!&rdquo; Doane slowly lifted his head and looked at M. Pour-munt. &ldquo;Very
      well,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;You are right, of course.&rdquo; On these last few
      words his voice broke, but he at once recovered control of it. He rose,
      with an effort, moved a few slow steps, hesitated, then got painfully down
      on one knee beside the limp groaning figure on the walk. He looked
      directly at Dr. Cassin, as he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he badly hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think so,&rdquo; replied the physician simply, wholly herself. &ldquo;The
      skull doesn't seem to be fractured. We may find some concussion, of
      course.&rdquo; Doane's breath whistled convulsively inward. He knelt there,
      silent, watching the deft fingers work. Then he said&mdash;under his
      breath, but audibly enough: &ldquo;What an awful thing to do! What a terrible
      thing to do!&rdquo; And got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boatwright hurried to help him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go with you, Elmer,&rdquo; said Doane.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Griggsby Doane
      moved, pain shot through his lame muscle. A vaguely heavy anxiety clouded
      his brain, engaged as it still was with the specters of confusedly ugly
      dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      The speckled area overhead was gradually coming clear; it appeared to be a
      plastered ceiling, very small; a little cell of a place... oh, yes, Elmer
      Boatwright's room!
    </p>
    <p>
      Faintly through the open window at the foot of the bed came the sound of a
      distant, shot; another; a rattle of them. And other, nearer shots. Then a
      slow whistling shriek and a crash. Then the rattle of a machine gun, quite
      clear. Then a lull.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sensed a presence; felt rather than heard low breathing; with an effort
      that was as much of the will as of the body he turned his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty was sitting there, close by the bed, gently smiling. Almost
      painfully his slow eyes took her in. She bent over and kissed him, then
      her little hand nestled in his big one. They talked a little; he in a
      natural enough manner, if very grave, spoke of his joy in finding her
      safe. But as he spoke his mind, not yet wholly awake, took on a morbid
      activity. Did she know what he had done in the night? Had they told her?
      Anxiously, as she answered him, he searched her delicately pretty face.
      How young she was! Dwelling amid tragedy, in a degree sobered by it, the
      buoyancy of youth glowed in her brown eyes, in the texture of her skin, in
      the waving masses of fine hair, in the soft vividness of her voice; the
      touch of tragedy would, after all, rest lightly on her slim shoulders. To
      her the world was young; of the bitter <i>impasse</i> of middle age she
      knew no hint. Men loved her, of course. Men had died for less than she....
      He pondered, swiftly, gloormly, the problem her very existence presented.
      And he looked on her and spoke with a finer tenderness than any he had
      before felt toward any living creature, even toward the wife who had left
      her soul on earth in the breast of this girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      He decided that they hadn't told her. After all, they wouldn't. They were,
      when all was said, adult folk. He couldn't himself tell her. But his
      predicament was pitiful. He knew now, from the honest love in her eyes,
      that not the least black of his sins had been the doubting her. Never
      again could he do that. But this realization brought him to the verge of
      an attitude toward Jonathan Braehey that it was impossible for him to
      entertain; the mere thought of that man roused emotions that he could not
      control. But emotions, all sorts, must be controlled, of course; on no
      other understanding can life be lived. If direct effort of will is
      insufficient, then counter-activity must be set up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty protested when he told her he meant to get up at once. But it was
      afternoon. He assured her that his wound was not serious; Dr. Cassin had
      admitted that, and he had slept deeply. H is muscles were lame; but that
      was an added reason for exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had brought in some of the clothing of the large Australian. As he
      pieced out a costume, he shaped a policy He couldn't, at once, fit into
      the life of the compound. He couldn't face Brachey. Not yet. The only hope
      of getting through these days of his passion lay in keeping himself
      desperately active. He weighed a number of plans, finally discarding all
      but one. Then he rang for a servant; and sent, while he ate a solitary
      breakfast, a chit to M. Pourmont.
    </p>
    <h3>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he engineer
      received him at three. Neither spoke of the incident that had brought them
      together in the night. To Doane, indeed, it was now, in broad daylight and
      during most of the time, but a nightmare, unreal and impossible. During
      the moments when it did come real, he could only set his strong face and
      wait out the turbulence and bewilderment it stirred in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Pourmont found him very nearly himself; which was good. He seemed,
      despite the bandaged shoulder and the thinner face, the Griggsby Doane of
      old. But his proposal&mdash;-he was grimly bent on it&mdash;was nothing
      less than to make the effort, that night, to get through to the telegraph
      station at Shau T'ing.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Fourmunt took the position that the thing couldn't be done. After
      losing two natives in the attempt, he had decided to conserve his meager
      manpower and fall back on the certain fact that the legations knew of the
      siege and were doubtless moving toward action of some sort. Besides, he
      added, Duane with his courage and his extensive knowledge of the local
      situation was the man above all others he could least well spare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane, however, pressed his point. &ldquo;Getting through the lines will be
      difficult, but not impossible,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Remember I did get through last
      night. I believe I can do it again to-night. Even if I should be captured
      they may hesitate to kill me. I would ask nothing better than to be taken
      before Kang. He would have to listen to me, I think. And if I do succeed
      in establishing communication with Peking I may be able to stir them to
      action. The Imperial Government can hardly admit that they are backing
      Kang. It may even be possible to force them, through diplomatic pressure
      alone, to repudiate him and use their own troops to overthrow him. But
      first Peking must have the facts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. Pourmont smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you vill step wiz me,&rdquo; he said, and led the way down a corridor to his
      spacious dining-room. There on the table, stood a large basket heaped with
      apples and pears. &ldquo;Vat you t'ink, Monsieur Doane! But yesterday comes <i>un
      drapeau bianc</i> to ze gate viz a let-tair from zis ol' Kang. He regret
      vair' much zat ve suffair <i>ici ze derangement</i>, an' he hope zat vair'
      soon ve are again <i>confortable</i>. In Heaven, perhaps he mean! <i>Chose
      donnante!</i> An' he sen' <i>des fruits</i> viz ze <i>compliments of Son
      Excellence</i> Kang Hsu to Monsieur Pourmont. <i>Et je vous demande,
      qu'est-ce que cela fait?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane considered this puzzle; finally shook his head over it. It was very
      Chinese. Kang doubtless believed that through it he was deluding the
      stupid foreigners and escaping responsibility for his savage course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally Doane won M. Pourmont's approval for his forlorn sally. He was, in
      a wild way, glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the few hours left to him he must work rapidly, think hard. That,
      too, was good. He decided to write a will. If he had little money to leave
      Betty, at least there were things of his and her mother's. Elmer
      Boatwright would help him. And he must tell Betty he was going. It was
      curiously hard to face her, hard to meet the eye of his own daughter. He
      winced at the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had returned to the residence before him. He asked for her now.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Pourmont, giving a moment more to considering this man, whom he had
      long regarded with a respect he did not feel toward all the missionaries,
      wondered, as he sent word to the young lady, what might underlie that
      strange quarrel of the early morning. The only explanation that occurred
      to him he promptly dismissed, for it involved the little Mademoiselle's
      name in a manner which he could not permit to be considered. M. Pourmont
      was a shrewd man; and he knew that the Mademoiselle was ashamed of
      nothing. Nothing was wrong there. Like his wife he had already learned to
      love the busy earnest girl. And then, leaving M. Doane in the
      reception-room waiting for her, he returned to his study and dismissed the
      whole matter from his mind. For the siege was cruel business. One by one,
      some one every day, men and women and children, were dying. The living had
      to subsist on diminishing rations, for he had never foreseen housing and
      feeding so large a number. There were problems&mdash;of discipline and
      morale, of tactics, of sanitation, of burying the dead&mdash;that must be
      met and solved from hour to hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, as he settled again into his endless, urgent task, M.
      Pourmont was not sorry that M. Doane had won his consent to this last
      desperate effort to reach those inhumanly deliberate white folk up at
      Peking; men whose minds dwelt with precedents and policies while their
      fellows, down here at Ping Yang, on a hillside, held off with diminishing
      strength the destruction that seemed, at moments, certain to fall.

      Betty as she entered the room attired in a long white apron over her
      simple dress, knew that he must again beg the question that lay between
      them. He could no more listen to the burden of her heart than to the agony
      of his own. Sooner or later, if he lived, he would have to work it out,
      decide about his life. If he lived....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said, quickly for him, holding her hand more tightly than he
      knew, &ldquo;I have some news which I know you will take bravely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could feel her steady eyes on him. He hurried on. &ldquo;I am going out again
      to-night. There seems a good chance that I may get through to Shau T'ing,
      with messages. I'm going to try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His desire was to speak rapidly on, and then go. But he had to pause at
      this. He heard her exclaim softly&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, Dad!&rdquo; And then after a
      silence&mdash;&ldquo;I'm not going to make it hard for you. Of course I
      understand. Any of us may come to the end, of course, any moment. We've
      just got to take it as it comes. But&mdash;I&mdash;it does seem as if&mdash;after
      all you've been through, Dad&mdash;as if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt himself shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No. It's my job, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Dad. Then you must do it. I know. But I do wish you could have
      a day or two more to rest. If you could&rdquo;&mdash;this wistfully&mdash;&ldquo;perhaps
      they'd let me off part of the time to take care of you. You know, I'm
      nursing. I'd be stern. You'd have to sleep a lot, and eat just \vhat I
      gave you.&rdquo; She patted his arm as she spoke; then added this: &ldquo;Of course
      it's not the time to think of personal things. But there's one thing I've
      got to tell you pretty soon, Dad. A strange experience has come to me.
      It's puzzling. I can't see the way very clearly. But it's very wonderful.
      I believe it's right&mdash;really right. It's a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rushed on with it. &ldquo;I wanted you to meet him to-night. He's&mdash;out
      in the trenches, all day, up the hill. We're expecting word&mdash;a
      cablegram&mdash;when they get through to us. And when that comes, I'd have
      to tell you all about it. He'll come to you then. But I&mdash;well, I had
      to tell you this much. It's been a pretty big experience, and I don't like
      to think of going through it like this without your even knowing about it
      from me, and knowing, too, no matter what they may say&rdquo;&mdash;her voice
      wavered&mdash;&ldquo;that it's&mdash;it's&mdash;all right.&rdquo; Her hands reached
      suddenly up toward his shoulders; she clung to him, like the child she
      still, in his heart, seemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could trust himself only to speak the little words of comfort he would
      have used with a child. He felt that he was not helping her; merely
      standing there, helpless in the grip of a fate that seemed bent on racking
      his soul to the final Emit of his spiritual endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This won't do,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have no right to give way. They need me in
      the hospital. I shall think of you every minute, Dad. I'm very proud of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She kissed him and rushed away. He walked back to Elmer Boatwright's room
      fighting off a sense of unreality that had grown so strong as to be
      alarming. It was all a nightmare now&mdash;the manly dogged faces in the
      compound, the wailing sounds from the native quarter, the intermittent
      shots, the smells, the very sun that blazed down on the tiling. Nothing
      seemed really to matter. He knew well enough, in a corner of his mind,
      that this mood was the most dangerous of all. It lay but a step from
      apathy; and apathy, to such a nature as his, would mean the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he busied himself desperately. The simple will he left for Boatwright
      with instructions that it was to be given to Betty in the event of his
      death. It seemed that the little man was one of a machine-gun crew and
      could not be reached until well on in the evening; he had turned fighter,
      like the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sewed up his tattered knapsack and filled it with a sort of iron
      ration. He wrote letters, including a long one to Henry Withery, addressed
      in care of Dr. Hidderleigh's office at Shanghai. He framed with care the
      messages that were to go over the wires to Peking. He ate alone, and
      sparingly. And early, as soon as darkness settled over the scene of petty
      but bitter warfare, he clipped out of the compound and disappeared,
      carrying no weapon but his walking stick.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>OANE walked,
      carelessly erect, to a knoll something less than a hundred yards northeast
      of the compound and off to the left of the ride pits. Here he stood for a
      brief time, listening. He purposed going out through the lines as he had
      come in through them, by crawling, hiding, feeling his way foot by foot.
      The line was thinnest in front of the rifle pits, and just to the left
      where the upper machine gun commanded a defile.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had allowed two hours for the journey through the lines, but it
      consumed nearly four. At one point he lay for an hour behind a stone
      trough while a squad of Lookers built a fire and brewed tea. A recurring
      impulse was to walk calmly in among those yellow men and go down fighting.
      It seemed as good a way as any to go. He found it necessary to hold with a
      strong effort of will to the thought of his fellow's in the compound; that
      to save them, and to save Betty, he must carry through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward one o'clock in the morning, now well to the eastward of the
      besieging force, he swung into his stride. It seemed, in the retrospect,
      absurdly like the play of children to be hiding and crawling about the
      hillsides. But he was glad now that he had somehow, painfully, kept his
      head. Barring the unforeseen, the diplomatic gentlemen up at Peking would
      find the news awaiting them when they came to their desks in the morning.
      After that noting that he might do would greatly matter. He could follow
      these powerfully recurring impulses if he chose; let the end come. That
      was now his greatest desire. Life had become quite meaningless. Except for
      Betty....

    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>hau T'ing was but
      another of the innumerable rural villages that dot northern China. Though
      there were a railway station, and sidings, and a quaintly American water
      tank set high on posts. The inns were but the familiar Oriental
      caravansaries; no modern hotel, no &ldquo;Astor House,&rdquo; had sprung up as yet to
      care for newly created travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he approached the stream that ran through a loess canyon a mile or more
      west of the village he glimpsed, ahead, a group of soldiers seated about a
      fire. Just behind them were stacks of rifles; this much he saw and
      surmised with the help of the firelight. And the first glow of dawn was
      breaking in the east. He left the highway and swung around through the
      fields, passing between scattered grave mounds from whose tops the white
      joss papers fluttered in the gray twilight like timid little ghosts.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the gorge by the old suspension footbridge, with the crumbling
      memorial arches at either end bearing, each characteristic inscriptions
      suggestive of happiness and peace. Looking down-stream he could dimly see
      that the railway bridge lay, a tangle of twisted steel, in the stream,
      leaving the abutments of white stone rearing high in the air with wisps of
      steel swinging aimlessly from the tops.
    </p>
    <p>
      He half circled the village, and waited outside the eastern gate until the
      massive doors swung open at sunrise.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the leading inn, and gave up an hour to eating the food in his
      knapsack and cleaning his mud-dyed clothing. The innkeeper informed him,
      when he brought the boiled water, that another white man had been there
      for three days. After this Doane went down to the station. A solitary
      engine was puffing and clanking among the sidings, apparently making up a
      train.
    </p>
    <p>
      A number of the blue-turbaned military police stood sentry-go here and
      there about the yard, each with fixed bayonet. Within the room that was at
      once ticket office and telegraph station sat the Chinese agent cheerfully
      contemplating a slack day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane wrote out his messages, and stood over the man until they were sent;
      then walked slowly back toward the inn. His task, really, was done. He
      would wait until night, of course; there might be replies. But at most his
      only further service would be in carrying hopeful messages to the
      beleaguered folk at Ting Yang. Beyond that he would be but one more human
      unit to fight and to be fed. Debit and credit, they seemed just about to
      balance, those two items. Fastening his door he stretched out on the <i>kang</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was awakened at the close of day by the innkeeper bringing food. The
      man set out two plates on the dusty old table. Doane sat on the edge of
      the <i>kang</i> and drowsily wondered why. He had slept heavily. He stood
      up; moved about the room; he was only a little stiff. Indeed his strength
      was surely returning. He felt almost his old self, physically.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a knock at the door. In Chinese he called, &ldquo;Enter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door slowly opened, and a drab little man came in, walking with a
      slight limp, and stood looking at him out of dusty blue eyes. He carried a
      packet of papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grigg!&rdquo; he exclaimed softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henry Withery!&rdquo; cried Doane, &ldquo;What on earth are you doing here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Withery smiled, and laid hat and packet on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've arranged to dine with you,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;You won't mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not, Henry. But why are you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My plans were changed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently. Do sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came back to find you. I've been waiting here for a chance to get
      through. We've worried greatly, of course. A rumor came from the Chinese
      that you were killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I nearly was,&rdquo; said Doane quietly. A cloud had crossed his face as he
      listened. At every point, apparently, at each fresh contact with life, he
      was to be brought face to face with his predicament. It would be pitiless
      business, of course, all the way through, for the severest judge of all he
      had yet to face dwelt within his own breast; long after the world had
      forgotten, that judge would be pronouncing sentence upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got through to Shanghai?&rdquo; he asked abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Withery, touched by his appearance, a little disturbed by his nervously
      abrupt manner, inclined his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's out, I suppose. What are they saying about me, Henry? Really,
      you'd better tell me. I've got to live through this thing, you know. I may
      as well have the truth at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Withery lowered his eyes; fingered the chopsticks that lay by his plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;No, Grigg, it's not out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know of it. Surely others do, then. And they'll talk. It's the
      worst way. It'll run wild. I'd rather face a church trial than that.&rdquo; He
      was himself unaware that he had been constantly brooding upon this aspect
      of his trouble, yet the words came snapping out as if he had thought of
      nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Grigg,&rdquo; said Withery, in the same deliberately thoughtful way, &ldquo;I
      want you to let me talk. I've come way back here just to do that.
      Hidderleigh showed me your letter. Then in my presence, he destroyed it. I
      have promised him I would speak of it to no one but you. ... Neither you
      nor I could have foreseen just how Hidderleigh would take this. He is, of
      course, as he has always been, a dogmatic thinker. But like others of us,
      he has grown some with the years. He's less narrow, Grigg. He knows you
      pretty well&mdash;your ability, your influence. He respects you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Respects me?&rdquo; Doane nearly laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He sees as clearly as you or I could that any human creature may
      slip. And he knows that no single slip is fatal. Grigg, he wants you to go
      back and take up your work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane could not at once comprehend this astonishing statement. He was
      deeply moved. Withery by his simple friendliness had already done much to
      restore in his mind, for the moment, a normal feeling for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he feels, Grigg, that you ought to marry again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane shook his head abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I can't consider that. Not now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As he said to me, Grigg, 'It is not good for man to be alone!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Withery let the subject rest here, and asked about the fighting. The whole
      outside world was watching these Hansi hills, it appeared. The Imperial
      Government was already disclaiming responsibility. Troops were on their
      way, from Hong Kong, from the Philippines, from Indo-China.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be a month or so before they can get out here,&rdquo; mused Doane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! At best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meantime, the compound will fall at the first really determined attack.
      They've been afraid of Pour-mont's machine guns&mdash;I heard some of
      their talk last night, and the night before&mdash;but let Kang come to a
      decision to drive them in and they'll go. That will settle it in a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will they have the courage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so. You and I know these people, Henry. They're brave enough. All
      they lack is leadership, and organization. And this crowd have a strong
      fanaticism to hold them up. Once let Kang appeal to their spirit and
      they'll have to go in to save face. For if they can't be seen the only
      danger is of an accident here and there. And, for that matter, Kang may
      simply be waiting for Pourmont to use up his ammunition. It can't last a
      great while, not in a real siege, which this is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Withery a little later, &ldquo;here is a lot of mail for
      Pourmont's people. It's been accumulating. There was no way to get it to
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take it in,&rdquo; said Doane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You? You don't mean that you're going to ran that gauntlet again, Grigg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He untied the packet, and looked through the little heap of
      envelopes. One was a cablegram addressed to Jonathan Brachey. He held it
      in tense fingers; gazed at it long while the pulse mounted in his temples.
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he said, almost casually then, &ldquo;I'm going hack in. They'll be
      looking for me.&rdquo; But his thoughts were running wild again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Withery said, before he left, &ldquo;I'm going to ask you not to answer
      Hidderleigh's request until you've thought it over carefully. My own
      feeling is that he is right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; said Doane, &ldquo;my final decision should be&mdash;as I think it
      will&mdash;that I can't go back. What will they do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I've promised him, I'll go in and take up your work. As soon as this
      trouble is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That knocks out your year at home, Henry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but what matters it? Very likely I shall find more happiness in
      working, after all. That isn't what disturbs me.... Grigg, if you leave
      the church it will be, I think, the severest blow of my life. I&mdash;I'm
      going to tell you this&mdash;for years I've leaned on you. You didn't
      know, but I've made a better job of my life for knowing that you too were
      hard at it, just beyond the mountains. We haven't seen much of each other,
      of late years, but I've felt you there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane's stern face softened as he looked at his old friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I've felt you, Henry,&rdquo; he replied gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your blunders are those of strength, not of weakness, Grigg. Perhaps your
      greatest mistake has been in leaning a little too strongly on yourself.
      What I want you to consider now is giving self up, in every way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Duane shook his great head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Henry&mdash;no! I've given to the uttermost for years. And it has
      wrecked my life&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Grigg! Don't say that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;put it as you will. The trouble has been that I was doing
      wrong all the time&mdash;for years&mdash;as I told you back in Tiaman, I
      was doing the wrong thing. It led, all of it, to sin. For that sin, of
      course, I've suffered, and must suffer more. The best reason I could think
      of for going back would be to keep this added burden off your shoulders.
      But that would be wrong too. It's getting a little clearer to me. I know
      now that I've got to face my doubts and my sins, take them honestly for
      whatever they may be. Each life must function in its own way. In the
      eagerness of youth I chose wrong. I must now take the consequences.
      Good-by, now! There's barely time to slip through the lines before dawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Withery rose. &ldquo;I'll go with you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I won't allow that. You haven't the strength. You're not an outdoor
      man We should have to separate anyway; together we should almost certainly
      be caught. No. You stay here and get word through to them from day to day
      if you can find any one to undertake it. It will mean everything to them
      to hear from the outside world. Good luck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took the packet and went out.
    </p>
    <h3>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>gain it was dawn
      Griggsby Doane stood on the crest of a terraced hi'! looking off into the
      purple west. But a few miles farther on lay Ping Yang.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath him, near the foot of the slope, four coolies were already at the
      radiating windlasses of a well, and tiny streams of yellow water were
      trickling along troughs in the loess toward this and that field, where
      bent silent farmers waited clod in hand to guide the precious fluid from
      furrow to furrow. Still farther down, along the sunken highway, a few
      venturesome muleteers led their trains. No outposts in the Looker uniform
      were to be seen. And he heard no shots. It would be a lull, then, in the
      fighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      He descended the hill, dropped into the road, and walked, head high,
      toward Ping Yang. As he swung along he heard, far off, the shots his ears
      had strained for on the hill; one, another, then a spattering volley; but
      he walked straight on. The Mongols and Chihleans on the road gave him no
      more than the usual glance of curiosity. He passed through a village; Ping
      Yang would be the next. The railway grade&mdash;here an earthen rampart,
      there a cutting, yonder a temporary wooden trestle&mdash;paralleled the
      highway, cutting into the heart of old China like a surgeon's knife,
      letting out superstition and festering poverty, letting n the strong
      fluids of commerce and education. He felt the health of it profoundly,
      striding on alone through the cool, dear morning air. It was imperfect, of
      course, this Western civilization that he had so nearly come to doubt;
      yet, materialistic in its nature or not, it was the best that the world
      had to offer at the moment. It was what the amazing instinct in man to
      push on, to better his body and his brain, had brought the world to. It
      seemed, now, a larger expression of the vitality he felt within himself,
      the force that he had so lavishly expended in a direction that was wrong
      for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt this, which could not have been less than the beginning of a new
      focus of his misdirected, scattered powers, and yet he walked straight on
      toward the red army that was sworn to kill all the whites. And though his
      brain still told him, coolly, without the slightest sense of personal
      concern, that he would probably be slain within the hour, his heart, or
      his rising spirit, as calmly dismissed the report.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might come, of course. He literally didn't care. Death might come at
      any moment to any man. The present moment was his; and the next, and the
      next, until the last whenever it should come. He walked with a thrilling
      sense of power, above the world. For the world, life itself, was suddenly
      coming back to him. He had been ill&mdash;for years, he knew now&mdash;of
      a sick faith. Now he was well. If the old dogmatic religion was gone, he
      was sensing a new personal religion of work, of healthy functioning, of
      unquestioning service in the busy instinctive life of the world. He would
      turn, not away from life to a mystical Heaven, but straight into life at
      its busiest, head up, as now on the old highway of Hansi, trusting his
      instinct as a human creature. No matter how difficult the start he would
      plunge in and live his life out honestly. Betty remained the problem; he
      knit his brows at the thought; but the new flame in his heart blazed
      steadily higher. Whatever the problems, he couldn't he headed now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a morbid, sick fool I've been!&rdquo; It was the cry of a heart new born
      to health. It occurred to him, then, as he heard his own voice, that this
      new sense of light had come to him as suddenly as that other light that
      smote Paul on the Damascus road. It had the force, as he considered it
      now, of a miracle....

      the highway and the curious, pressing country folk a considerable number
      of yellow turbans crowding the road canyon. There must have been a hundred
      or more, with many rifle muzzles slanting crazily above them. After a
      moment the rabble broke toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane did not wait for them to discover him, but raising his stick and
      calling for room to pass he walked in among them. He stood head and
      shoulders above them, a suddenly appearing white giant whom a few resisted
      at first, but more gave way to as he pushed firmly through. Emerging on
      the farther side he walked on his way without so much as looking back. And
      not a shot had been fired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road wound its way between steep walls of loess, so that ii was
      impossible at any point to see far ahead. He came upon other, smaller
      groups of the Lookers. Only one man, the largest of them, threatened him,
      but as the man raised the butt of his rifle Doane snatched the weapon from
      him and knocked him down with it; then tossed it aside and strode on as
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came at length to a scenic arch in a notch. Through the arch Ping Yang
      could be seen in its valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped and looked. Near at hand were the tents of some of the Looker
      soldiery; beyond lay the village; and beyond that on the hillside, the
      compound of the company, lying as still as if it were deserted. There were
      no puffs of smoke, no sounds along the village street; between the
      outlying houses small figures appeared to Le bustling about, but they made
      no noise that could be heard up here. The scene was uncanny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane, however, went on down the hill. None of the Lookers were in
      evidence now on the winding street, but only the silent, curious
      villagers; this until two soldiers in blue came abruptly out of a house;
      and then two others firmly holding by the arms a man in red and yellow
      with an embroidered square on the breast of his tunic that marked him as
      an officer of rank. Other soldiers followed, one bearing a large curved
      sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane stopped to watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without ceremony the officer's wrists were tied behind his back. He was
      kicked to his knees. A blue soldier seized his queue and with it jerked
      his head forward. The swordsman, promptly, with one clean blow', severed
      the neck; then wiped his sword on the dead man's clothing and marched away
      with the others, carrying the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Duane shivered slightly, compressed his lips, and, paler, walked on. He
      passed other blue soldiers in the heart of the village, and a row of
      Lookers standing without arms. Emerging from the straggling groups of
      houses beyond the village wall he took the road up the hill. Away up the
      slope he could see the men of the outposts standing and sitting on the
      parapets of the rifle pits. At the gate of the compound he called out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gate opened, and closed behind him. Within stood men of the garrison,
      and women, and behind them the Chinese. All looked puzzled. Many tongues
      greeted him at once, eagerly questioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked about from one to another of the thin weary faces with burning
      eyes that hung on his slightest gesture, and slowly shook his head. He
      could answer none of their questions. He was searching for one face that
      meant more to him than all the others. It was not there. He walked on
      toward the house occupied by the Boatwrights. Just as he was turning in
      there he saw Betty. She was tunning across from the residence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On, Dad!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You're back!&rdquo; Her arms were around his neck. &ldquo;How
      wonderful! And you're well&mdash;like your old self.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0008" id="linkimage-0008"> </a>

      <a href="images/0357.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than my old self, dear,&rdquo; he said, with a tender smile, and kissed
      her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't stay, Dad. I just ran out. Wasn't it strange&mdash;I saw you from
      the window! But what's happened? What is it? Everybody's so puzzled. Have
      the troops come?&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's something. Everybody's terribly excited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand it myself, dear. Though I walked through it,
      apparently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, look! They're opening the gate! What is it?&rdquo; She hopped with
      impatience, like a child, and clapped her hands. &ldquo;Oh, I mustn't stay! But
      tell m, do you think this dreadful business is over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it is, Betty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ran back to her post. And he returned to the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      An odd little cavalcade was moving deliberately up the hill. In front
      marched a soldier in blue bearing a large white flag (an obviously Western
      touch, this). Behind him came a squad in column of fours, on foot and
      unarmed; then a green sedan chair with four pole-men; behind this three
      pavilions with carved wooden tops, of the sort carried in wedding
      processions, each with four bearers; and last another squad of foot
      soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just outside the gate they came to a halt. The soldiers formed in line on
      either side of the road. An officer advanced and asked permission to
      enter. This was granted. At once the chairmen set down their burden. The
      carved door opened, and a young Chinese gentleman stepped out. He was
      tall, slim, with large spectacles; and moved with a quiet dignity that
      amounted to a distinction of bearing. His long robe was of shimmering blue
      silk embroidered in rose and gold; and the embroidered emblem on his
      breast exhibited the silver pheasant of a mandarin of the fifth class. On
      his head, the official, bowl-shaped straw hat with red tassel was
      surmounted with a ball or button of crystal an inch in diameter set in a
      mount of exquisitely worked gold. His girdle clasp also was of worked gold
      with a plain silver button. The shoes that appeared beneath the hem of his
      robe were richly embroidered and had thick white soles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calmly, deliberately, he entered the compound. One of the engineers, an
      American, addressed him in the Mandarin tongue. He replied, in a deep
      musical voice, with a pronounced intonation that gave this mellow
      language, to a casual ear, something the sound of French.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineer bowed, and together they moved toward the residence, where a
      somewhat mystified M. Pourmont awaited them. But first the mandarin turned
      and signaled to the pavilion bearers, who still waited outside the gate.
      These came in now, and it became evident that the ornate structures were
      laden with gifts. There were platters of fruits and of sweetmeats, bottles
      of wine, cooked dishes, and small caskets, some carved, others lacquered,
      that might have contained jewels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane, quietly observing the scene, found something familiar in the
      appearance of the envoy. Something vaguely associated with the judge's
      yamen at T'ainan-fu. Certainly, on some occasion, he had seen the man. He
      stood for a brief time watching the two figures, a white man in stained
      brown clothing, unkempt of appearance but vigorous in person, walking
      beside the elegant young mandarin, appearing oddly crude beside him,
      curiously lacking in the grace that marked every slightest movement of the
      silk-clad Oriental; and the picture dwelt for a time among his thoughts&mdash;the
      oldest civilization in the world, and the youngest. Crude vigor, honest
      health, contrasted with a decadence that clung meticulously to every
      slightest subtlety of etiquette. And behind the two, towering above the
      heads of the ragged bearers, the curving pointed roofs of the three
      pavilions, still gaily bizarre in form and color despite the weatherbeaten
      condition of the paint; a childish touch, suggestive of circus day in an
      American village. Suggestive, too, whimsically, of the second childhood of
      the oldest race.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane, reflecting thus, slowly followed them to the residence.
    </p>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>onathan Brachey
      sat moodily on the parapet. Down below, the compound (a crowded mass of
      roofs within a rectangle of red-gray wail) and below that the straggling
      village, stood out as blocked-in masses of light and shadow under the
      slanting rays of the morning sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      A French youth, beside him, polishing his rifle with a greasy rag, looked
      up with a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey shook his head; he had no information. He looked over toward the
      other pit. The Australian in command there (three nights earlier they had
      buried Swain) waved a carelessly jocular hand and went on nibbling a
      biscuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing might be over; it might not. Brachey found himself almost
      perversely disturbed, however, at the prospect of peace. He had supposed
      that he hated this dirty, bloody business. He saw no glory in fighting,
      merely primitive blood-lust; an outcropping of the beast in man; evidence
      that in his age-long struggle upward from the animal stage of existence
      man had yet a long, long way to climb. But from the thought of losing this
      intense preoccupation, of living quietly with the emphasis again placed on
      personal problems, he found himself shrinking. What a riddle it was!
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke shortly to the French youth, took up his own rifle, and led the
      way up the hill to the bullet-spattered farm compounds. They were quite
      deserted. Only the huddled, noxious dead remained. He went on up the
      hillside, searching all the hiding-places of those red and yellow vandals
      who had filled his thoughts by day and haunted his sleep at, night; but
      all were empty of human life. A great amount of rubbish was left&mdash;cooking
      utensils, knives, old Chinese-made rifles and swords, bits of uniforms. He
      found even a jade ring and a few strings of brass cash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weary of spirit he returned to the rifle pits only to find these, too,
      deserted. From the upper redoubt a man was waving, beckoning. Apparently
      the compound gate was open, and a group of soldiers standing in line
      outside; but these soldiers wore blue. Through his glasses he surveyed the
      moving dots near the village; none wore red and yellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was still waving from the redoubt. The French youth, he found now,
      was looking up at him, that eager question still in his eyes. He nodded.
      With a sudden wild shout the boy ran down the hill, waving bis rifle over
      his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was peace&mdash;sudden, enigmatic. Brachey sat again on the parapet.
      Griggsby Doane was doubtless there (Brachey knew nothing of his journey;
      he had not seen Betty. What could he say to him, to the father whom Betty
      loved?
    </p>
    <p>
      This wouldn't do, of course. He rose, a set dogged expression on his long,
      always serious face, and went slowly down the hill; and with only a nod to
      this person and that got to his tent. Once within, he closed the flaps and
      sat on the cot. He discovered then that he had brought with him one of the
      strings of cash, and jingled it absently against his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Voices sounded outside. Men were standing before the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the flaps parted, and he beheld the spectacled, pleasantly smiling
      face of Mr. Po.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, more shortly than he knew. &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Po stepped inside, letting the flaps fall together behind him. He made
      a splendid figure in blue and gold, as he removed the round hat with its
      red plume and crystal ball and laid it on the rude table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad to see you're still sound of life and limb and fresh as a
      daisy,&rdquo; he remarked cheerfully. &ldquo;With permission I will sit here a bit for
      informal how-do chin-chin, and forget from minute to minute all ceremonial
      dam-foolishness.&rdquo;

      Mr. Po expansively, &ldquo;I've certainly had a pretty kettle of fish about my
      ears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey filled and lighted his pipe, and yielded his senses for a moment
      to the soothing effect of the fragrant smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the fighting really over?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why? What's happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Po indulged in his easy, quiet laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To begin at first blush,&rdquo; he said, settling comfortably back as If
      launched on a long narrative, &ldquo;while out on scouting leap in dark I
      stumbled plump on Lookers, and by thunder, it was necessary to trust
      broken reed of lying on stomach hi open ground!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They caught you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! For hell of a while I held breath, but with dust in nose it
      became unavoidable to sneeze. I would then have lost head promptly but
      officer of yamen entourage of Kang spotted me and said, 'What the devil
      you doing here!' With which I explain of course that I escape by hook or
      crook from white devils. Then I appear before general and demand audience
      discussion with old Kang. Old reprobate received me and made long speech.
      Perfectly absurd! He said I must go to T'ainan-fu as his particular guest
      and speak to His Excellency Pao Ting Chuan his message, like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'For many years I have known and respected your abilities as scholar and
      statesman of huge understanding ability. We have both seen, you and I,
      continuing unprincipled encroachment of foreign devil on preserves of our
      ancient and fruitful land, while the sorrow of our own Hansi Province
      under heel of foreign mining syndicate despot is matter of common ill
      repute to us both. Now as loyal friend and unswervingly determined on
      destroying all evil influence of foreign devils, I invite you as guest to
      share with me pleasure of witnessing capture and utter destruction of
      foreign compound at Ping Yang. Omens agree on midnight of to-day week,
      following banquet of state and theatrical performance at my headquarters,
      at which favorite amateur actor Wang Lo Hsu will recite historical
      masterpiece, &ldquo;The Song of Wun Hsing.&rdquo; And as my cooks are all wretched
      creatures, unworthy of catering to poorest classes, I beg of you bring
      delicately expert cook of Canton that I may again rejoice in delightful
      memory of sweet lotus soup.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Po paused to light a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you went back to Tiainan?&rdquo; asked Brachey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I was taken back against grain as prisoner of large armed guard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you delivered the message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pao didn't accept, of course. Though I don't see how he could get out of
      it. He had no soldiers to speak of, did he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, some. These he sent by northern road to region of Shan Tang,
      only thirty <i>li</i> away from Ping Yang. And then he accept, for His
      Excellency is great statesman. Nobody yet ever put it over on His
      Excellency, not so you could notice it. Without frown or smile he assemble
      secretaries, runners and lictors of yamen. banner-men, some concubines and
      eunuchs and come post-haste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he's here now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. We have large establishment at temple over on neighboring hill.
      And everything's all right. O. K.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll forgive me if I don't at all understand why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally. I am going to make clear as cotton print. For a day or so
      everything was as disorderly as the dickens, of course. You couldn't hear
      yourself think. And sleep? My God, there wasn't <i>any</i>. And of course
      after death of old reprobate Lookers went to pieces and raised Ned. It
      became necessary to punish leaders and all that sort of thing. You see,
      Dame Rumor gets move on in China, runs around like scared chicken, faster
      than telegraph, I sometimes think. And when Lookers heard stories, that
      Imperial Government up at Peking wasn't so crazy about giving them
      support, and might even hand them double-cross lemon, they began to think
      about patching holes in fences. They just blew up. And His Excellency&rdquo;&mdash;he
      chuckled&mdash;&ldquo;he grasped situation like chain lightning. Oh, but he's
      whale of a fellow, His Excellency!&rdquo; Brachey smoked reflectively as he
      studied this curiously bloodless enthusiast. Evidently behind the
      humorously inadequate English speech of Mr. Po there was, if it could be
      got at, a stirring drama of intrigue. A typical Oriental drama, bearing a
      smooth surface of silken etiquette but essentially cruel and bloody. The
      difficulty would be, of course, in getting at it, drawing it out piecemeal
      and putting it together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Excellency will now clean up whole shooting match,&rdquo; Mr. Po went on.
      &ldquo;No more Ho Shan Company!&rdquo; And he waved his cigarette about to indicate
      the compound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that goes, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! His Excellency has at once telegraphed agent-general at Tientsin
      for final show-down price on surrender of all leases, agreements,
      expenses, bribes and absolute good riddance. They say three million taels
      cash. To-morrow we shall throw it at their heads. And so much for that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm!&rdquo; mused Brachey. &ldquo;Pretty quick work. Rather takes one's breath away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! But His Excellency's son of a gun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently. But I'm still in the dark as to how this rather extraordinary
      change came about. Did I understand you to say that Kang is dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! Night before last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did that happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well&mdash;it's just as well not to give this away&mdash;on arrival
      at Ping Yang His Excellency made at once prepare bowl of sweet lotus soup
      and send it with many compliments and hopes of good omens to old devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;there was poison in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! Pretty darned hard to put it over His Excellency. After that it
      was no trouble at all to behead commanders of Looker troops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; was Brachey's only comment. He proceeded to draw out, bit by
      bit, other details of the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one stepped before the tent, and a strong voice called:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Brachey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a nervously abrupt movement Brachey sprang up and threw back the
      flaps; and beheld, standing there, stooping in order that he might see
      within, the giant person of Griggsby Doane.

      coldly. Doane's strong gaunt face worked perceptibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you come in, sir? The tent is&rdquo;&mdash;there was a pause&mdash;&ldquo;the
      tent is small, but... You are perhaps acquainted with Mr. Po Sui-an of the
      yamen of His Excellency Pao Ting Chuan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Doane bowed toward the Chinese gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have seen Mr. Po at the yamen,&rdquo; he said, speaking now in the
      slow grave way of the old Griggsby Doane. &ldquo;You bring good news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; Mr. Po lighted a cigarette. &ldquo;We shall doubtless in jiffy see
      you again at T'ainan-fu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane looked thoughtfully, intently at him, then replied in the simple
      phrase, &ldquo;It may be.&rdquo; To Brachey he said now, producing a white envelope,
      &ldquo;I found this, cablegram held for you at Shau T'ing, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey took the envelope; stood stiffly holding it unopened before him.
      For a moment the eyes of these two men met. Then Doane broke the tension
      by simply raising his head, an action which removed it from the view of
      the men within the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; he said rather gruffly. And &ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Po.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was well out of ear-shot when Brachey's gray lips mechanically uttered
      the two words, &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; From a distant corner of the compound came the
      fresh voices of young men&mdash;Americans and Australian and English&mdash;raised
      in crudely pleasant harmony They were singing <i>My Bonnie Lies Over the
      Ocean</i>. As they swung into the rolling, rollicking refrain, women's
      voices joined in faintly from here and there about the compound....
      Brachey seemed to be listening. Then, again, abruptly starting into
      action, he stepped outside the tent and stared across the courtyard after
      Griggby Doane.... Then, as abruptly, he remembered his guest and returned
      within the tent, with an almost muttered &ldquo;I beg your pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, go on&mdash;read your cablegram!&rdquo; said Mr. Po good-humoredly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradley looked at him; then at the envelope&mdash;turning it slowly over.
      His hands trembled. This fact appeared to disturb him. He held one hand
      out before his face and watched it intently, finally lowering it with a
      quick nervous shake of the head. He seated himself again on the cot; tore
      off an end of the envelope; caught his breath; then sat motionless with
      the bit of paper that meant to him everything in life, or nothing, hanging
      between limp fingers. A puzzling reminder of the strange man, Griggsby
      Doane, was the painful throbbing in his head.... They were singing again,
      about the compound&mdash;it was the college song of his youth, <i>Solomon
      Levi</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought, with another of those odd little mental and physical jerks,
      again of his guest; and heard himself saying&mdash;weakly it seemed, like
      a man talking in dreams&mdash;&ldquo;You will think me...&rdquo; But found himself
      addressing an empty enclosure of canvas. Mr. Po had slipped out and
      dropped the flaps. That he could have done this unobserved frightened
      Brachey a little. He looked again at his trembling hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he raised the envelope. Until this moment he had assumed that it
      could be but one message to himself and Betty; but now he knew vividly
      better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anything might have happened. It was unthinkable that he should want the
      courage to read it. He had foreseen no such difficulty. Perhaps if it had
      come by any other hand than that of Griggsby Doane....
    </p>
    <p>
      His thoughts wandered helplessly back over the solitary life he had led...
      wandering in Siam and Borneo and Celebes, dwelling here and there in
      untraveled corners of India, picking up the quaint folklore of the Malay
      Peninsula, studying the American sort of social organization in the
      Philippines... eight years of it! He had begun as a disheartened young
      man, running bitterly away from the human scheme in which he found no
      fitting niche. Yes, that was it, after all; he had run away! He had begun
      with a defeat, based his working life on just that. The five substantial
      books that now stood to his name in every well-stocked library in America,
      as in many in England and on the Continent, were, after all, but stop-gaps
      in an empty life. They were a subterfuge, those books.........All the hard
      work, the eager close thinking, was now, suddenly, meaningless. That he
      had chosen work instead of drink, that he had been, after all, a decent
      fellow, pursuing neither chance nor women, seemed immaterial.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curse of an active imagination was on him now, and was riding him as
      wildly as ever witch rode a broomstick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very bit of paper in his hand was nothing if not the symbol of his
      terrible failure in the business called living. As he had built his work
      on failure, was he, inevitably, to build the happiness of himself and
      Betty on the same painful foundation. Even if the paper should announce
      his freedom? Bitterly he repeated aloud the word, &ldquo;Freedom!&rdquo; Then
      &ldquo;Happiness?&rdquo;... What were these elusive things? Were they in any sense
      realities?
    </p>
    <p>
      He nerved himself and read the message:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolute decree granted you are free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tossed it, with its unpunctuated jumble of words, on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later, though he still indulged in this scathing self-analysis,
      the habit of meeting responsibilities that was more strongly a part of his
      nature than in this hour of utter emotion he knew, began to assert itself.
      The strong character that had led him, after all, out to fight and to
      build his mental house, was largely the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slowly got up and stood before the square bit of mirrror that hung on
      the rear tent-pole; then looked down at his mud-stained clothes.
      Deliberately, almost painfully, he shaved and dressed. It was
      characteristic that he put on a stiff linen collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, to a man of his stripe, just one thing to do: and that thing he
      was going at directly, firmly. Until it was done he could not so much as
      speak to Betty. Of the outcome of this effort he had no notion; he was
      going at it doggedly, with his character rather than with his mind. Indeed
      the mind quibbled, manufactured little delays, hinted at evasions. He even
      listened to these whisperings, entertained them; but meanwhile went
      straight on with his dressing.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s he emerged from
      the tent sudden noises assailed his ears. A line of young men danced in
      lock step, doing a serpentine from one areaway to another, and waving and
      shouting merrily as they passed. There was still the singing, somewhere;
      one of the songs of Albert Chevalier, who had not then been forgotten. He
      heard vaguely, with half an ear, the enthusiastic outburst of sound on the
      final line:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Missie 'Enry 'Awkins is a first-class nyme!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So it was a day of celebration! He had forgotten that it would be. But of
      course! Even the Chinese were at it; he could hear one of their flageolets
      wailing, and, more faintly, stringed instruments.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked directly to the building occupied by the Boatwrights; sent in
      his card to Mr. Doane.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was shown into a little cubicle of a room. Here was the huge man,
      rising from an absurdly small work table that had been crowded in by the
      window, between the wall and the foot of the bed. He was writing,
      apparently, a long letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey, an odd figure to Doane's eyes, in his well-made suit and stiff
      white collar, stood on the sill, as rigid as a soldier at attent ion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am interrupting you,&rdquo; he said, almost curtly,
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time Griggsby Doane caught a glimpse of the man Brachey
      behind that all but forbidding front; and he hesitated, turning for a
      moment, stacking his papers together, and with a glance at the open window
      laying a book across them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had said, kindly enough, &ldquo;Oh, no, indeed! Come right in.&rdquo; But his
      thoughts were afield, or else he was busily, quickly, rearranging them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey stepped within, and closed the door. Here they were, these two, at
      last, shut together in a room. It was a moment of high tension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said Doane, still busying himself at the table, but waving an
      immense hand toward the other small chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Brachey stood... waiting... in his hand a folded paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally Doane lifted his head, with a brusk but not unpleasant, &ldquo;Yes,
      sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey, for a moment, pressed his lips tightly together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Doane,&rdquo; he said then, clipping his words off short, &ldquo;may I first ask
      you to read this cablegram?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane took the paper, started to unfold it, but then dropped it on the
      table and stepped forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now for the first time Brachey sensed, behind this great frame and the
      weary, haggard face, the real Griggsby Doane; and stood very still,
      fighting for control over the confusion in his aching head. This was, he
      saw now, a strong man; a great deal more of a personality than he had
      supposed he would find. Even before the next words, he felt something of
      what was coming, something of the vigorous honesty of the man. Doane had
      been through recent suffering, that was clear Something&mdash;-and even
      then, in one of his keen mental dashes, Brachey suspected that it was a
      much more personal experience than the Looker attack&mdash;something had
      upset him. This wasn't a man to turn baby over a wound, or to lose his
      head in a little fighting. No, it was an illness of the soul that had
      hollowed the eyes and deepened the grooves between them. But it didn't
      matter. What did matter was that he was now, in this gentle mood,
      surprisingly like Betty. For she had a curious vein of honesty; and she
      said, at times, just such unexpectedly frank, wholly open things as he
      felt (with an opening heart) that the father was about to say now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Brachey&rdquo;&mdash;this was what he said, with extraordinary simplicity
      of manner&mdash;&ldquo;can you take my hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Brachey had spoken his reply his voice would have broken. Instead he
      gripped the proffered hand. And during a brief moment they stood there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Doane quietly, &ldquo;sit down.&rdquo; And he read the cablegram. After
      some quiet thought he said, &ldquo;Have you come to ask for Betty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The directness of this question made speech, to Brachey, even more nearly
      impossible than before. He bowed his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane had dropped into the little chair by the little table. He sat, now,
      thinking and absently weighing the cablegram in one hand. Finally,
      reaching a conclusion, he rose again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best way, I think, will be to settle this thing now.&rdquo; He appeared to
      be speaking as much to himself as to his caller. &ldquo;I'll get Betty. You
      won't mind waiting? They don't have call bells in this house.&rdquo; And he
      returned the cablegram and went out of the room, leaving the door ajar
      behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brachey stepped over to the window, thinking he might see Betty when she
      came, but it gave on an inner court. He stared out at the gray tiling. The
      moment was, to him, terrible. He stood on the threshold of that strange
      region of the spirit that is called happiness. The door, always before
      closed to him (except the one previous experience when it proved but an
      entry into bitterness and desolation) had opened, here at the last,
      amazingly, at his touch. And he was afraid to look.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed an hour later when footsteps sounded outside, and the outer door
      opened. Then they came in, father and daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty, rather white, stood hesitant, looking from one to the other. Doane
      placed a gently protecting arm about her slim shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't told her,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That is for you to do. I want you both to
      wait while I look for the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was gone. Betty came slowly forward. Brachey handed her the cablegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I can't read it,&rdquo; she said, with a tremulous little laugh. &ldquo;John&mdash;I'm
      crying!&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he door squeaked.
      Miss Hemphill looked in; stopped short; then in a sudden confusion of mind
      in which indignation struggled with bewilderment for the upper hand,
      stepped back into the hall. Before she could come down on the decision to
      flee, Dr. Cassin joined her; curiously, carrying her medicine case.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the physician's brisk, &ldquo;Mr. Doane sent word to come here at once. Do
      you know what is the matter?&rdquo; Miss Hemphill could only reply, rather
      acidly, &ldquo;I can't imagine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boatwright came into the corridor then, followed by Doane. She walked
      with firm dignity, her enigmatic face squarely set. And when he ushered
      them into the room, she entered without a word, but remained near the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long moment the room was still; a hush settling over them that
      intensified the difficulty in the situation. Miss Hemphill stared down at
      the matting. Mrs. Boatwright's eyes were fixed firmly on the wall over the
      bed. The one audible sound was the heavy breathing of Griggsby Doane, who
      stood with his back to the door, brows knit, one hand reaching a little
      way before him. He appeared, to the shrewd eyes of Dr. Cassin, like a man
      in deep suffering. But when he spoke it was with the poise, the sense of
      dominating personality, that she had felt and admired during all the
      earlier years of their long association. Of late he had been ill of a
      subtle morbid disease of which she had within the week witnessed the
      nearly tragic climax; but now he was well again.... Mary Cassin was a
      woman of considerable practical gifts. Her medical experience, illuminated
      as it had been by wide scientific reading, gave her a first-hand knowledge
      of the human creature and a tolerant elasticity of judgment that
      contrasted oddly with the professed tenets of her church, with their iron
      classification as sin of much that is merely honest human impulse, that
      might even, properly, be set down as human need. She saw clearly enough
      that the quality in the human creature that is called, usually, force, is
      essentially emotional in its content&mdash;and that the person gifted with
      force therefore must be plagued with emotional problems that increase in
      direct ratio with the gift. Unlike Mrs. Boatwright, who was, of course,
      primarily a moralist, Mary Cassin possessed the other great gift of
      dispassionate, objective thought. I think she had long known the nature of
      Doane's problem. Certainly she knew that no medical skill could help him;
      her advice, always practical, would have taken the same direction as Dr.
      Hidderleigh's. It brought her a glow of something not unlike happiness to
      see that now he was well. The cure, whatever it might prove to have been,
      was probably mental. Knowing Griggsby Doane as she did, that was the only
      logical conclusion. For she knew how strong he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There has existed among us a grave misapprehension&rdquo;&mdash;thus Doane&mdash;&ldquo;one
      in which, unfortunately, I have myself been more grievously at fault than
      any of you. I wish, now, before you all, to acknowledge my own confusion
      in this matter, and, further, to clear away any still existing
      misunderstanding in your minds.... Mr. Brachey has established the fact
      that he is eligible to become Betty's husband. That being the case, I can
      only add that I shall accept him as my only son-in-law with pride and
      satisfaction. He has proved himself worthy in every way of our respect and
      confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mary Cassin broke the hush that followed by stepping quickly forward and
      kissing Betty; after which she gave her hand warmly to Brachey. Then with
      a word about her work at the hospital she went briskly out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hemphill started forward, only to hesitate and glance in a spirit of
      timid inquiry at the implacable Mrs. Boatwright. To her simple,
      unquestioning faith, Mr. Doane and Mary Cassin could not together be
      wrong; yet her closest daily problem was that of living from hour to hour
      under the businesslike direction of Mrs. Boatwright. However, having
      started, and lacking the harsh strength of character to be cruel, she went
      on, took the hands of Betty and Brachey in turn, and wished them
      happiness. Then she, too, hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elmer Boatwright was studying his wife. His color was high, his eyes
      nervously bright. He was studying, too, Griggsby Doane, who had for more
      than a decade been to him almost an object of worship. Moved by an
      impulse, perhaps the boldest of his life&mdash;and just as his wife said,
      coldly, &ldquo;I'm sure I wish you happiness,&rdquo; and moved toward the door&mdash;he
      went over and caught Betty and Brachey each by a hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't understood this,&rdquo; he said&mdash;and tears stood in his eyes as
      he smiled on them&mdash;&ldquo;but now I'm glad. Betty, we are all going to be
      proud of the man you have chosen. I'm proud of him now.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE day of sudden
      and dramatic peace was drawing near its close. Seated on the parapet of a
      rifle pit Betty and Brachey looked out over the red-brown valley. Long,
      faintly purple shadows lay along the hillside and in the deeper hollows.
      From the compound, half-way down the slope, a confusion of pleasant sounds
      came to their ears&mdash;youthful voices, snatches of song, an
      energetically whistled Sousa march, the quaintly plaintive whine of
      Chinese woodwinds&mdash;while above the roofs of tile and iron within the
      rectangle of wall (that was still topped with brown sand-bags) wisps of
      smoke drifted lazily upward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems queer,&rdquo; mused he, aloud, &ldquo;sitting here like this, with
      everything so peaceful. During the fighting I didn't feel nervous, but now
      I start at every new sound. I loathed it, too; but now, this evening, I
      miss it, in a way.&rdquo; He gazed moodily down into the short trench. &ldquo;Right
      there,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;young Bartlett was hit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you brought him in under fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Chinaman helped me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it was you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He wouldn't have done it. I watched from the
      window.&rdquo; Her chin was propped on two small lists; her eyes, reflective,
      were looking out over the compound and the valley toward the walled temple
      on the opposite slope with its ornate, curving roofs and its little group
      of trees that were misty with young foliage. &ldquo;I've been thinking a good
      deal about that, and some other things. All you said, back there on the
      ship, about independence and responsibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe I care to remember that,&rdquo; said he quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, John, if you will say startling, strong things to an impressionable
      girl&mdash;and I suppose that's all I was then&mdash;you can't expect her
      to forget them right away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face relaxed into a faint, fleeting smile. But she went earnestly on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I know it wasn't really long ago. Not if you measure it by
      weeks. But if you measure it by human experience it was&mdash;well,
      years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was sober again; cheek on hand, gazing out into those lengthening,
      deepening shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was what we quarreled about, John. I felt terribly upset. I was blue&mdash;I
      can't tell you! Just the thought of all your life meant to you, and how I
      seemed to be spoiling it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A strong hand drew one of hers down and closed about it. &ldquo;I'm going to try
      to tell you something, dear,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You thought that what I said to
      you, on the ship, was an expression of a real philosophy of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what else could it have been, John?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was just a chip&mdash;right here.&rdquo; He raised her hand and with it
      patted his shoulder. &ldquo;It was what I'd tried for years to believe. I was
      bent on believing it. You know, Betty, the thing we assert most positively
      isn't our real faith. We don't have to assert that. It's likely to be what
      we're trying to convince ourselves of.... I'm just beginning to understand
      that, just lately, since you came into my life&mdash;and during the
      fighting. I had to bolster myself up in the faith that a man can run away,
      live alone, because it seemed to be the only basis on which I, as I was,
      could deal with life. The only way I could get on at all. But you see what
      happened to me. Life followed me and finally caught me, away out here in
      China. No, you can't get away from it. You can't live selfishly. It won't
      work. We're all in together. We've got to think of the others..... I'm
      like a beginner now&mdash;going to school to life. I don't even know what
      I believe. Not any more. I&mdash;I'm eager to learn, from day to day. The
      only thing I'm sure of&rdquo;... he turned, spoke with breathless awe in his
      voice... &ldquo;is that I love you, dear That's the foundation on which my life
      has got to be built. It's my religion, I'm afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty's eyes filled; her little fingers twisted in among his; but she
      didn't speak then.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shadows stretched farther and farther along the hillside. The sun, a
      huge orange disc descending amid coppery strips of shining cloud, touched
      the rim of the western hills; slid smoothly, slowly down behind it,
      leaving a glowing vault of gold and rose and copper overhead and a
      luminous haze in the valley. Off to the eastward, toward Shau T'ing and
      the crumbling ruins of the Southern Wall (which still winds sinuously for
      hundreds of miles in and out of the valleys, and over and around the
      hills) the tumbling masses of upheaved rock and loess were deeply purple
      against a luminous eastern sky.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you let me travel with you, John? I've thought that I could draw
      while you write. Maybe I could even help you with your books. It would be
      wonderful&mdash;exploring strange places. I'd like to go down through
      Yunnan, and over the border into Siam and Assam and the Burmah country.
      I've been reading about it, sitting in the hospital at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There would be privation&mdash;and dangers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn't be afraid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not with you. And if&mdash;if anything happened to you, I'd want to go,
      too.... Of course, there'd be other problems coming up. Don't think I'm
      altogether impractical, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you thinking of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated. &ldquo;Children, John. I know we shan't either of us be satisfied
      to live just for our happiness in each other. I couldn't help thinking
      about that, watching you here, during the siege.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we shan't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And with your work what it is&mdash;what it's got to be there's our first
      problem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have to take life as it comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know.&rdquo; They were silent again. Gradually the brilliant color was
      fading from the sky and the distant hills softening into mystery....
      &ldquo;Father says that we'll find marriage a job&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Full of surprises and compromises and giving up. He says it's very
      difficult, but very wonderful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think,&rdquo; said Brachey, his voice somewhat unsteady, &ldquo;that it
      would be the most wonderful job in the world. Its very complexities, the
      nature of the demands it must make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a long silence he asked, so abruptly that she looked swiftly up:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you ever pray, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;yes, I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you teach me? I've tried&mdash;up here in the trenches. I've thought
      that maybe I'd pick up a copy of the English prayer-book. They'd have it
      at Shanghai or Tientsin....&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>usk was mounting
      the hill-slopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a strange talk father and I had. Nearly all the afternoon&mdash;while
      you were checking up ammunition and things. It's the first time he's
      really sat down with me like that like a friend, I mean&mdash;and talked
      out, just as he felt. Oh, he's been kind. But it's queer about father and
      me. You see, when they sent me over to the States, I was really only a
      child. Mother was dead then, you know. Father was always hoping to get
      over to see me, but there was all the strain of building up the missions
      after the Boxer trouble, and then he'd had his vacation. And he couldn't
      afford to bring me out here just for the journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brachey broke in here. &ldquo;Did you ask him if he would marry us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. &ldquo;Yes. And he won't. That's partly what I'm going to tell you.
      He's resigned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He thought of having Mr. Boatwright do it. But it seems that his
      position is rather difficult. On account of his wife. She'll never be
      friendly to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could see, though, that Dad was glad about our plan for an early
      wedding. Of course, he's had me to think of, every minute. He did say that
      the certain knowledge that I'm cared for will make it easier for him to
      carry out his plans. But he wouldn't tell me what the plans are. It's odd.
      He doesn't like to think of me as a responsibility. I could see that. I
      mean, that he might have to do something he didn't believe in in order to
      earn money for me. He said that he's been for years in a false position. I
      never saw him so happy. He acts as if he'd been set free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he has,&rdquo; Brachey reflected aloud. &ldquo;It is strange&mdash;almost as
      if we represented opposite swings of the pendulum, he and I. Perhaps we
      do. I've not had enough responsibility, he's had too much. Probably one
      extreme's as unhealthy as the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've worried some about him, John. But he begs me not to. He's planning
      now to sell all his things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything. Books, even. And his desk, that he's had since the first
      years out here. Mr. Withery is going to be in charge at T'ainan, and Dad's
      leaving the final arrangements to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak as if your father were going away, far off. And in a hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is. That's the strange thing. Just to tell about it, like this, makes
      it seem'&mdash;well, almost wild. But when you talk with him you feel all
      right about it. He's so steady and sure. Just as if at last he's hit on
      the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The night drew its cloak swiftly over the valley. For a long time after
      this conversation they sat there in silent communion with the dim hills;
      she nestling in his arms; he dreaming of the years to come in which his
      life&mdash;such was his hope&mdash;might through love find balance and
      warmth.
    </p>
    <h3>

    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>oane was at the
      residence when Brachey left Betty there&mdash;at the door, chatting with
      M. Pourmont. He walked away with Brachey. And the tired but still genial
      Frenchman looked after them with a puzzled frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stroll a bit with me, will you?&rdquo; said Doane. &ldquo;I've got a few things to
      say to you.&rdquo; And outside the gate, he added soberly: &ldquo;About the beastly
      thing I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've forgotten that,&rdquo; said Brachey; stiffly, in spite of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you haven't. You never will. Neither shall I. What I have to say is
      just this&mdash;it was an overwrought, half-mad man who attacked you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I've come to see that. All you'd been through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I'd been through, Brachey, wasn't merely hardship, fighting, wounds.
      It was something else, the wreck of my life. I'd had to stand by, in a
      way, and look at the wreckage. I was doing the wrong thing, living wrong,
      living a lie. For years I fought it, without being able to see that I was
      fighting life itself. You see, Brachey, the power of dogmatic thinking is
      great. It circumscribed my sense of truth for years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fell silent for a moment, looking up at the stars. Then, simply, he
      added this:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to know the whole truth. I feel that it is due you. My
      struggle ended in sin. The plainest kind&mdash;with a woman&mdash;and
      without a shred of even human justification. Just degradation.... I can
      see now that it was a terrific shock. It nearly pulled me under, very
      nearly. They want me to stay in the church, but I can't, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Brachey, &ldquo;you wouldn't want to do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't. I went through the more or less natural morbid phases, of
      course. That attack on you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was partly exhaustion,&rdquo; said Brachey. &ldquo;You weren't in condition to
      analyze a situation that would have been difficult for anybody. And of
      course I was in the position of breaking my pledge to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was more than that, Brachey. The primitive resurgence in me simply
      reached its climax then. No&mdash;let me have this out! I suspected you
      because I had learned to suspect myself. That blow was a direct result of
      my own sin. And I want you to know that I've come to see it for what it
      was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm!&rdquo; mused Brachey. They were standing by a pile of weathering timbers,
      beside the old Chinese highway. &ldquo;Shall we sit a while?&rdquo; Then&mdash;&ldquo;I'd
      have to think about that.&rdquo; Finally&mdash;&ldquo;I don't know but what your
      analysis is sound. But&rdquo;&mdash;he mused longer, then, his voice clouded
      with emotion, broke out with&mdash;&ldquo;God, man, what you must have suffered!
      And after our row.... I can't bear to think of it.&rdquo; And then, quite
      forgetting himself, he rested a hand on Doane's arm. It was perhaps the
      first time in his adult life that he had done so demonstrative a thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doane compressed his lips, in the darkness, and stared away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he replied, after a moment, &ldquo;I've suffered, of course. I even
      made a rather cowardly try at suicide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my return from Shau T'ing I walked into the Looker lines in broad
      daylight. I rather hoped to go out that way. But the fighting was over. I
      couldn't even get killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed as confiding as a child, this grave powerful man. And he was
      Betty's father! Brachey was sensitively eager to help him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty said you had new plans. I wonder if you would feel like telling me
      of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I've meant to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going back to the States?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Not now. Not with things like this. My worldly possessions, when
      everything is sold, will probably come down to a thousand or fifteen
      hundred dollars. My library is worth a good deal more than that, but won't
      bring it. I have a little in cash; not much. I've estimated that two
      hundred dollars&mdash;gold, not Mex.&mdash;will get me down to Shanghai
      and tide me over the first few delays. I'm giving Betty the rest, and
      arranging for Withery to turn over to her the proceeds of any sale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what are you going to do down there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Work. Preferably, for a while, with my hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean at common labor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Why not? I have a real gift for it. And I'm very strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would mean putting yourself with yellow coolies. The whites wouldn't
      like it; probably they wouldn't let you. And you have a brain. You're a
      trained executive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't take a small mental job. A large one&mdash;-that would really
      keep me busy&mdash;yes. But there'll be no chance of that at first. And I
      must be fully occupied. I want to be outdoors. I may take up some branch
      of engineering, by way of private study. But at the moment I really don't
      care....&rdquo; He smiled, in the dark. Brachey felt the smile in his voice when
      he spoke again. &ldquo;I was forty-five years old this spring, Brachey. That's
      young, really. I have this great physical strength. And I'm free. If I
      have sinned, I have really no bad habits. I probably shan't be happy long
      without slipping my shoulders under some new burden&mdash;a good heavy
      one. But don't you see how interesting it will be to start new, at
      nothing, with nothing? What an adventure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won't be with nothing, quite. There's your experience, your mental
      equipment. With that, and health, and a little luck you can do anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Doane, &ldquo;it is, after all, a clean start. I've been terribly
      shaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So have I,&rdquo; said Brachey gently. &ldquo;And I'm starting new, too.&rdquo; He rose;
      stood for a moment quietly thinking; then turned and extended his hand.
      &ldquo;Mr. Doane, here we are, meeting at life's crossroads. You're starting out
      on something pretty like my old road, and I'm starting on a road not
      altogether unlike yours. The next few years are going to mean everything
      to each of us. And what we both do with our lives is going to mean
      everything to Betty. Let's, between us, make Betty happy.&rdquo; His voice was a
      little out of control, but he went resolutely on. &ldquo;Let's, between us, help
      her to grow&mdash;enrich her life all we can&mdash;give her every chance
      to develop into the woman your daughter has a right to become!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doane sprang up; stood over him; enveloped his hand in a huge fist and
      nearly crushed it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Reverend Henry Withery came in that night, on a shaggy Manchu pony,
      with his luggage behind on a cart. And late the following afternoon a
      wedding took place at the residence. A great event was made of it by the
      young people of the compound. The hills were searched for flowers. A
      surprising array of presents appeared. Mrs. Boatwright was prevented from
      attending by a severe headache, but her husband, at the last moment, came.
      The other T'ainan folk were there. His Excellency, Pao Ting Chuan, with
      fifteen attendant mandarins, in full official costume, among whom was Mr.
      Po Sui-an, lent the color of Oriental splendor to the occasion. His
      Excellency's gift was a necklace of jade with a pendant of ancient worked
      gold. Withery performed the ceremony; and Griggsby Doane gave the bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young couple were leaving in the morning for Peking, at which city the
      groom purposed continuing for the present his study of the elements of
      unrest in China.
    </p>
    <p>
      Directly after the wedding and reception a remarkably elaborate dinner was
      served in the large diningroom, at winch Griggsby Doane appeared for a
      brief time to join in the merrymaking with an appearance of <i>savoir
      faire</i> that M. Pourmont, shrewdly taking in, found reassuring; but he
      early took a quiet leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dusk, after the talking machine had been turned on and the many young
      men were dancing enthusiastically with the few young women, the newly
      wedded couple slipped out and walked down to the gate. Here, outside in
      the purple shadows, they waited until a huge man appeared, dressed in
      knickerbockers, a knapsack on his back and a weatherbeaten old walking
      stick in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bride clung to him for a long moment. The groom wrung his hand. Then
      the two stood, arm in arm, looking after him as he descended to the
      highroad and strode firmly, rapidly eastward, disappearing in the village
      and reappearing on the slope beyond, waving a final farewell with stick
      and cap&mdash;very dimly they could see him&mdash;just before he stepped
      through the old scenic arch at the top of the hill.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
